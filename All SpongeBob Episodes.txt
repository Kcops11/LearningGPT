Announcer: Ah, the sea. So fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life, home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly. (The giant foghorn wakes up SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: Today's the big day, Gary!

Gary: Meow!

SpongeBob: Look at me! I'm naked! (Gets His Pants On) Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.

Gary: Meow!

SpongeBob: (SpongeBob tries to throw a weight) I'M READY!! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!

Starfish: Go SpongeBob!

SpongeBob: There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating. The Krusty Krab, Home of the Krabby Patty. With a 'Help Wanted' sign in the window! For years I've been dreaming of this moment! I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look him straight in the eye, lay it on the line, and I can't do this! (he runs, but Patrick blocks his way) Patrick!

Patrick: Where do you think you're going?

SpongeBob: I was just....

Patrick: (cutting him off) No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job!

SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough!

Patrick: Whose first words were, "May I take your order?"

SpongeBob: Mine were.

Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?

SpongeBob: I did.

Patrick: Who's a.... (thinks) ....uh, who's.... (thinks even harder) ....who's a big yellow cube with holes?

SpongeBob: I am!

Patrick: Who's ready?

SpongeBob: I'm ready!

Patrick: Who's ready?

SpongeBob: I'm ready!

Patrick: Who's ready? (Does a split)

SpongeBob: I'm ready!! (with his confidence restored, he runs toward the restaurant. There, An Octopus is spraying the glass windows to eliminate graffiti of himself with the word 'Loser.' He sees SpongeBob.)

Octopus: Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?

SpongeBob: (in background) Go SpongeBob! Go SpongeBob! Go self! Go self! (The Octopus noticed the 'Help Wanted' sign and runs inside.)

Octopus: Mr. Krabs! (cut to the ordering window, where Mr. Krabs is smelling a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him) Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you... (too late.)

SpongeBob: (off-screen) Permission to come aboard, captain! (cut to SpongeBob, casting a shadow across the restaurant) (manly voice) I've been training my whole life for the day I could finally join the Krusty Krew, (regular voice) And now I'm ready. (while walking, he accidentally steps on a nail. He trips and bounces all over the last. The Octopus and Mr. Krabs just stare at each other. SpongeBob finally comes to a stop) So, uh, when do I start?

Krabs: Well lad, it seems like you don't even have your sea legs.

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward! He'll vouch for me.
(Krabs and Squidward walk to the corner, where Squidward puts it plain and simple.)

Squidward: No. (Krabs winks. The two walk back over.)

Krabs: Well lad, we'll give you a test and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew! Go fetch me... (SpongeBob pulls out a notepad) a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula with, ah, port-and-starboard-attachments, and turbo drive! And don't come back till you get one! (Krabs puts a Krusty Krab hat on SpongeBob. SpongeBob, overjoyed, looks at himself in the mirror. He then gets serious)

SpongeBob: Aye aye, captain! (reading) One hydrodynamic spatula, port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up sir! (he leaves)

Krabs: Hurry on! (to Squidward) We'll never see that lad again.
Squidward: You're terrible! A hydro-what? (the two laugh. Cut to outside, where SpongeBob walks off. Just then, five boats come and encircle around the restaurant. The doors open. Cut to Squidward and Krabs still laughing. Krabs stops, then Squidward.)

Krabs: That sounded like hatch doors! (Krabs smells something, then close in on his wiggling eyes.) Do you smell it? That smell. The kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells? smelly. (his eyes bug open) (silently) Anchovies.

Squidward: What?

Krabs: Anchovies!!! (the anchovies come in, hoards of them, just swarming and swarming. Squidward tries to maintain some order)

Squidward: Please, please, quiet! (the anchovies stop bickering) Is this any way to behave, hmm?

Anchovy: Meep!

Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register?
(moment of silence, then the anchovies rock the ordering boat around a bit, very violently I might add. Cut to SpongeBob, walking to a store shaped like a treasure chest.)

SpongeBob: Barg'n Mart: meeting all your spatula needs. (cut back to Squidward and Mr. Krabs, stuck in the ordering boat and being swung across, literally a sea of anchovies.)

Squidward: One single file line was all I asked! (cut to the ship being thrown up)

Krabs: Button down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! (getting thrown back up, the ship is in pieces) We're taking on water,
Mr. Squidward! (getting thrown back up again, Krabs is holding Squidward) I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! (cut back to SpongeBob, shopping)

SpongeBob: (humming) Spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments? (cut back to the restaurant, where Squidward and Krabs are hanging onto a pole)

Krabs: Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! (they do climb and tidal wave after tidal wave of anchovies nears closer and closer) Well, this is the end. Good-bye, Mr. Squidward!

Squidward: Oh Mr. Krabs! (the two start to cry. Then, some blinking red lights from off-screen illuminate the two. They look up to see, SpongeBob with the spatula he was sent off to receive. He's using it as a propeller to keep him in air. He sings a tune as he arrives.)

SpongeBob: Did someone order a spatula? (Squidward and Mr. Krabs babble to themselves on how he obtained this) One hydrodynamic spatula with (two other spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one) port-and-starboard attachments, and let's not forget the turbo drive! (the two extending spatulas whirl around and smack Squidward and Krabs around) Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! (SpongeBob makes a double-spin and flies into the kitchen window) (to anchovies) Who's hungry?

Things that bother you never bother me,
 I feel happy as pie, a-ha!
 Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight,
 Having a wonderful time.


Haven't got a lot, I don't need a lot,
 Coffee's only a dime,
 Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight,
 Having a wonderful time.


Just take it from me, I'm just as free as any daughter,
 I do what I like, just when I like, and how I love it!


I'm right here to stay,  when I'm old and gray,
 I'll be right in my prime,
 Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight,
 Having a wonderful time.


Krabs: That was the greatest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants! Welcome aboard! (Krabs gives him a nametag with 'SpongeBob' written on it.)

Squidward: But Mr. Krabs-

Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!

Squidward: (weakly) Hooray, Mr.-

Krabs: Hip-Hip!

Squidward: (quickly) Hooray, Mr.-

Krabs: Hip-hip!

Squidward: (quickly) Hooray, Mr. Krabs!

Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting the booty. (he proceeds to drive a wheelbarrow full of money into his office. Then, Patrick walks in.)

Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Crew!

Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?

Patrick: One Krabby Patty please. (as if as a signal, SpongeBob flies back through the ordering window via spatula and starts doing some stuff. Cut to outside, where Patrick gets hit by a wave of Krabby Patties and is flung out the door.)

Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee....

 Having a wonderful time.

Narrator: As the day begins in Bikini Bottom, Squidward steps out of his home. He takes in the tranquility of his neighborhood until a bent flower catches his eye. With a swift and careful touch, he straightens it back to perfection.


 Suddenly, he spots a stray shell on his well-kept lawn. With a quick glance to ensure no one is watching, he kicks it onto SpongeBob's yard. From the confines of his pineapple home, SpongeBob peers out his window, his eyes landing on the shell. A spark of inspiration strikes him, and he slides energetically into his garage.


 The garage door opens, revealing SpongeBob, now donning a leaf blower on his back. The noise startles Squidward from his hammock, leading him to resort to earplugs for peace. Unperturbed, SpongeBob approaches the shell, pointing his leaf blower at it. Despite his initial efforts, the shell merely floats upward and drops back down. Undeterred, he tries again, only to create a hole in the ground from the intense air pressure. 


Meanwhile, Squidward, enjoying a peaceful meal outdoors, is suddenly drenched in a cascade of sand from SpongeBob's blower. Rushing to his neighbor's aid, SpongeBob blows off the sand, inadvertently causing sand to go into Squidward's eyes and his eyeballs to pop out. Noticing the mess he's made, SpongeBob points his blower at the pile of sand on his yard, proclaiming "You!" (subtitle at the bottom), and sucks up all the sand into his leaf blower bag. 


Content with his clean yard, SpongeBob suddenly finds his leaf blower shaking uncontrollably. Moments later, the sand he had sucked up is spat out, covering his yard once again. Undeterred, SpongeBob empties his leaf blower bag, collects all the sand, and tries to start the blower once more. After a considerable pull, he is sent flying with the blower, past an intersection, causing chaos. 


In a surprising turn of events, the blower sucks up all the water in the ocean, leaving Squidward gasping for air in the suddenly dry environment. SpongeBob, noticing the oversized bag on his leaf blower, witnesses it explode, resulting in a sandstorm that covers the entirety of Bikini Bottom.


Emerging from a sand-made door, SpongeBob admires his now clean yard before retreating into his house. Meanwhile, Squidward, covered in sand, watches as his surroundings are transformed into a sandy landscape. And as if to add insult to injury, the stray shell floats down, landing perfectly on his nose.

SpongeBob: Wow, four stingers.
(He then puts away the telescope and puts on some black glasses. Cut to the jellyfish, just hanging out, and SpongeBob floats over besides it with net in hand. Cut to the jellyfish alone, where SpongeBob's foot stretches out from off-screen and then the rest of his body appears. He attempts to grab the jellyfish in his net, but he ends up catching himself in the net. The jellyfish flies away. Just then, SpongeBob hears some struggling noises from off-screen. He arrives at the top of a hill, where he sees a giant clam attempting to eat a squirrel, who is wearing some sort of space suit underwater. SpongeBob gasps as he sees the squirrel struggling to stay her ground)

SpongeBob: Where have I seen this before?

(He then takes out his handy dandy 'Field Guide' and skims through the pages)

SpongeBob: Here it is!

(SpongeBob comes upon a picture of the squirrel)

SpongeBob: Land squirrel! That little squirrel is in trouble.

(cut to the squirrel, who is bashing the squirrel into the ground)

Squirrel: Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners! You're about as ugly as homemade soup.

SpongeBob: Hooray, land squirrel!

(cut back to The Squirrel, who is oblivious to the clam resurfacing and jumping right at her. Cut to SpongeBob, who is shock, his glasses shoot up)

SpongeBob: Look out! Hold on, little squirrel!

(he does a karate yell in front of the clam, then does the same while bouncing to different sides. He jumps high in the air, and lands on top of the clam)

SpongeBob: You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished!
(SpongeBob strains)
SpongeBob: Hey, I'm actually doing it!

(SpongeBob strains some more)
(The squirrel holds open the clam's mouth and SpongeBob goes flying face-first into a coral reef.)

SpongeBob: Your shell is mine!

(SpongeBob attempts to grapple with an appendage in the clam's mouth. The clam then slams shut.)
Squirrel: Hold on there, little square dude!

(she then gets SpongeBob out and kicks the clam around some more and finally kicks it across the sea. The clam whimpers. The squirrel leans down to see if SpongeBob is OK)

SpongeBob: Hey, you like karate too!
(SpongeBob does a series of karate moves, spins in mid-air, and lands on his head with a splat.)
SpongeBob: So, uh, what's your name?

Squirrel: Sandy! So, what do y'all call yourself?

(SpongeBob runs up a nearby rock and jumps off.)
SpongeBob: I---'m SpongeBob!

(One of the corners of his head gets stuck in the ground.)
Sandy: Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this!

(she walks next to a huge rock and slaps it with her hand, making a gong sound effect. The gong sound effect intensifies and the rock shatters into tiny pebbles.)

SpongeBob: Oh.

(Sandy stands with her hands on her hips and a big, proud smile on her face.)

SpongeBob: Oh yeah? Well, watch this! (he prepares to do a karate move, but all he does is make an armpit fart noise. Sandy walks on screen laughing)

Sandy: I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah!

(Sandy chops SpongeBob's head, leaving a triangle-shaped indent at the top.)
SpongeBob: Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah!
(He tries to chop Sandy's head, but her air helmet stops him.)
SpongeBob: D'oh. Say, what's that thing on your head?

Sandy: Why, that's my air helmet.

SpongeBob: May I try it on?

Sandy: Heck no. I need it to breathe! I gotta have my air.

SpongeBob: Me too! I love air! Air is good.

Sandy: No kidding?

SpongeBob: Why, "air" is my middle name! The more air, the better! Can't get enough of that air.

Sandy: Shee-oot. How about coming over tomorrow for tea and cookies then? (shows a map) You are Here! (Points at "Sandy's House") Don't be late!

SpongeBob: Okay, see you tomorrow.
Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
Patrick (getting up): Huh?

SpongeBob: I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of...air.
(Patrick takes off his sunglasses)

Patrick: Do you mean she puts on airs?

SpongeBob: I guess so.

Patrick: That's just fancy talk. If you want to be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are.

SpongeBob (holding his pinky up): How's that?

Patrick: Higher!

SpongeBob (holding his pinky higher): Like that?

Patrick: Now that's fancy! They should call you SpongeBob Fancypants!
At Sandy's Treedome
Patrick: Remember, when in doubt, pinky out. You can do it,
SpongeBob. I'll be watching.

SpongeBob: Thanks pal.

Sandy: Hello?

SpongeBob: Hi-ya, Sandy. It's me, SpongeBob!

Sandy: Hold on a sec, I'll let you in.

(buzzer sounds as water drains from entryway)
SpongeBob: Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in.....here.

Sandy: 'Course there's no water. Nothing but air.

(SpongeBob waves his hand around and smells this air)

SpongeBob: No water?

Sandy: That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!

SpongeBob: Problem? (laughs) Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! (takes deep breath, then lets out forceful cough) With no water.

Sandy: Well all right. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah! (SpongeBob is walking an inch forward and it makes weak squeaking sounds with every step) That's not in. In! (SpongeBob walks another inch with all the squeaking. Sandy runs and gets SpongeBob and takes his hand and runs off) You're a funny little dude.
Come on, I'll give you the grand tour.

(cut to the blazing sun and pan down where Sandy and SpongeBob are standing)

Sandy: This is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest... (SpongeBob gasps) ..Purest...

SpongeBob (while gasping): Maybe...

Sandy: ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath.

(cut to the birdbath, where a red robin is splashing and chirping)

Sandy: And there's my oak tree. (SpongeBob seems enticed by the water in the birdbath. He tries to sneak away, but stays until Sandy lets her guard down)

Sandy: It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane-- that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bee's knees? Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I... (SpongeBob finally escapes and wallows in the birdbath, absorbing all the water. He then jumps back to his original spot, and the bird is quite angry. SpongeBob gets back before Sandy notices) ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let's have that tea now. (does in-air karate moves and moves off-screen. SpongeBob gasps. He hears some knocking from outside. It's Patrick, pointing at his pinky)

Patrick: Pinky! Pinky!

(SpongeBob weakly holds up his pinky and gasps again. Cut to him sitting at a picnic bench. He holds up his bouquet)
SpongeBob:I brought you some flowers. (Sandy walks over)

Sandy: For me? How sweet! (Sandy grabs the flowers, which SpongeBob doesn't want to let go. She finally pries them loose and reveals SpongeBob's bony crusty looking hand) You OK?

SpongeBob: Yes, I'm OK.

Sandy: You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit.

SpongeBob: I can't imagine why.

Sandy: Can I get you anything.

SpongeBob: Water would be nice.

Sandy: I'm going to put these in a vase.

SpongeBob: Take your time. (he then gasps and stumbles toward the door and struggles to try and open it)
I gotta get out of here! Aaaaahh! (he then thinks)

Sandy: (in SpongeBob's head) I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree! (SpongeBob struggles even more)

Patrick: (in SpongeBob's head) When in doubt, pinky out.
(SpongeBob lifts his pinky. He then gets confidence and victorious music plays)

SpongeBob: I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it...(he then loses confidence again and the music stops)

Sandy: Why, these flowers are just beautiful! They'll last much, much longer in a glass of ice, cold water. (SpongeBob is totally enticed by the water. Sandy sits down across from him) So tell me about yourself. It must be fascinating being a sea critter.

(SpongeBob watches a drop of water drop down the side of the glass)

Sandy: SpongeBob? (a timer goes off) Oh, there's the cookies. (walks back into the tree) Be right back.

SpongeBob: I don't need it. I don't need it. I definitely don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I NEEEED IT!!! (he shoots up in the air, bounces off the ceiling and holds the glass)

Patrick: No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky! (SpongeBob holds up his pinky while guzzling down the whole glass)

SpongeBob: I'm a quitter! (SpongeBob cries out)

(Patrick enters into the dome and slams the door shut)

Patrick: You can't leave now! You'll blow it!

SpongeBob: Air is not good, Patrick! Air is not good!

(Patrick pries him off the door and carries him around)

Patrick: You're just being shy. Don't worry, buddy. You're doing fine. (starts getting weak) I won't let you blow.... this... (he drops SpongeBob and crawls on the floor, panting. He coughs and sputters) What kind of place is this?! (runs toward the door and tries to open it) There's no water in here!

(SpongeBob joins in on the door-opening struggle)

SpongeBob: I tried to tell you!

Patrick: We've got to get out of here!

SpongeBob: You're...doing it...wrong! (the two collapse on each other)

Patrick: Wait, no! We've got...to get...out... (cut to the blaring sun. Sandy walks out of the tree with tea and cookies)

Sandy: Come and get it! You're all gonna like this..(she screams and drops her tray. On the floor is a live-action sponge and starfish.)
(Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill these helmets with water)

Sandy: There, that ought to do it! If y'all wanted water, you should have asked.

(Sandy carries over a tray with three tea glasses. Everyone takes one)

Sandy: I propose a toast: to new friends!

(she drinks it. SpongeBob and Patrick lift their drinks up and they clink the glasses on the helmets, causing them to spill)

Sandy: Wait, hold on a second. (she places a tea bag in each helmet, allowing the two to drink the tea water.)
I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up!

(Patrick nudges SpongeBob and they both put their pinky up. The three drink up again and give a heartfelt sigh)
SpongeBob: Ah, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful.
(SpongeBob grabs wood, hammer, and nails, then starts building a bubblestand.)
Squidward: Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
Squidward: Ha, yeah right.
SpongeBob: Okay.
(SpongeBob taps on the nail lightly, then looks up at Squidward's window, and repeats this 5 times.)
Squidward: And now,for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you.
(Squidward starts to play. SpongeBob looks up and sees that Squidward is playing his clarinet, so he decides to finish building the stand quickly. Squidward looks out at SpongeBob.)
Squidward: I thought I... wha?
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward! Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
Squidward: Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Uh huh!
Squidward: Oh puh-leeze. I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles?
(Patrick's rock opens.)
Patrick: Good morning!
(Patrick falls off his rock.)
Squidward: Oh, boy.
(Patrick walks over to SpongeBob.)
SpongeBob: Good morning to you sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
Patrick: Hmmm, how much is it?
SpongeBob: Only a quarter.
Patrick: Sounds reasonable. Um, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Patrick.
(SpongeBob pulls out a quarter and gives it to Patrick.)
Patrick: Ah, one quarter.
(Patrick hands SpongeBob the quarter. SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real, and it bends.)
SpongeBob: Thank you.
Squidward: Ha, business is booming. How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Heh.
SpongeBob: One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go.
(Patrick grabs the wand from SpongeBob, inhales deeply and begins to blow, but nothing happens. After a while, SpongeBob puts up a lessons sign.)
SpongeBob: Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
Patrick: Uh, very well then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter?
(SpongeBob hands Patrick a quarter.)
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique! First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times. One, two three. Then pelvic thrust. Whooooooo, whooooooo. Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, then this, then that, then this and that, and then...
(SpongeBob blows three bubbles; one big duck and two small ducks.)
Patrick: Oooooh.
(SpongeBob pops out of nowhere and blows a box. Patrick giggles as SpongeBob blows a caterpillar.)
Patrick: Ahahaha.
(SpongeBob blows a boat bubble. It floats off, then pops and makes a foghorn noise.)
Squidward: Huh?
(Squidward looks at his clarinet.)
SpongeBob: And now... with two hands!
(SpongeBob inhales deeply, and blows an elephant bubble while circus music starts playing. Patrick starts laughing.)
Patrick: It's a giraffe!
(The elephant floats into Squidward's house and explodes. Squidward angrily walks outside and goes toward the bubblestand.)
SpongeBob: Excuse me sir, but we are cl...
Squidward: Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?
SpongeBob: We're not just blowing bubbles, we're making bubble art! Watch carefully. First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times. One, two three. Then pelvic thrust. Whooooooo, whooooooo. Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, then this, then that, then this and that, and then...
(SpongeBob blows a butterfly which flies over to Squidward, lands on his head, and finally pops.)
Squidward: That's not art! That's just annoying! Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard!
(SpongeBob and Patrick put their head down as they walk to Sponge's house.)
Squidward: You should be ashamed of yourselves! Bubbles. Ha. Art.
(Squidward mumbles, then picks up bubble wand, sniffs it, and inhales to blow a bubble. SpongeBob pops up out of nowhere.)
SpongeBob: That'll be 25 cents, sir.
Squidward: Ah, whoa, what? Oh, who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
SpongeBob: We also offer lessons for beginners.
Squidward: Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble? Here's your 25 cents!
(Squidward hands SpongeBob a quarter. SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real, and it bends.)
Squidward: Watch and learn.
(Squidward inhales deeply and begins to blow, but nothing happens.)
Squidward: Uhh, wait, wait, wait. One more time. Wait.
Squidward inhales and blows again. A small bubble comes out and quickly falls to the ground and pops. Squidward looks over ant SpongeBob and Patrick. They gulp then whistle. Squidward places another quarter on the stand.
Squidward: Just a mere warm-up.
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, remember the technique.
(Squidward keeps trying while SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to show him the technique.)
SpongeBob and Patrick: Technique, technique, tech-
(Squidward looks at them annoyed.)
SpongeBob: You're not doing the technique.
Squidward: Technique? Technique? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique! First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go... pelvic thrust. Whooooooo, whooooooo. Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, a little of that, this, that, and this. And that and this. this that this that. Then ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!! Squidward blows huge bubble that lifts him off of the ground.)
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: All right Squid! That was so good!
Patrick: Squid is number one!
Squidward: I really did it, didn't I? You guys didn't blow anything like that!
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: Now that's a bubble!
SpongeBob: You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique!
Patrick: Yeah, technique.
Squidward: Technique? Ha! SpongeBob, you don’t think I created that... (Squidward kisses one of his tentacle.)
Squidward: ...beautiful work of art with your help? Come on, it's in my genes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes!
Squidward: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
(Squidward goes back in his house.)
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward...
Squidward: I rock!
Squidward's bubble flies over them, covers Squidward's house, and pulls it out of the ground and up towards the surface of the ocean. SpongeBob notices then stops Patrick.
SpongeBob: Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: Hello my friends, you are looking at a...
(Squidward looks down and sees Bikini Bottom getting farther and farther away.)
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
Squidward: ...genius.
(The bubble explodes.)
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow!
(As house falls to the ground, SpongeBob and Patrick run towards their own houses. Squidward's house lands in its old spot, and he plays his clarinet.)
Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me. But to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful stinky mud puddle.
SpongeBob: What a great day. (SpongeBob rushes off scene for a bit) Hey, Sandy! Look! I'm Sandy! (SpongeBob looks like a sand castle. Next he dresses up like Squidward) Hey, Sandy? Who am I? (Sandy laughs as SpongeBob picks up a sandy phone and imitates Squidward) Hello, SpongeBob. Could you try and keep it down. I'm trying to be boring.
Sandy: (laughs) SpongeBob! (doorbell)
SpongeBob: Did anybody order 20 pepperoni and sand pizzas? (both laugh)
Lobster: Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hey, Larry.
Larry: You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy: Sure. Well, c'mon SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Coming. (next scene is everyone lifting weights)
Larry: Give it a try, Sandy. (Sandy lifts up a heavy weight)
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy. Well that's about enough for today, don't ya think?
Larry: How about a little more weight? Observe. (Larry lifts an even heavier weight)
SpongeBob: Alright, stand back everyone! (SpongeBob lifts a stick and sinks. No one cheers)
Sandy: Ya'll watch this. (Sandy lifts up something heavier and everyone cheers. Larry lifts up the 2 bleachers with citizens in them and everyone cheers even more)
Sandy: Way to go, Larry! (SpongeBob digs underground to a campfire)
SpongeBob: Can I borrow a couple of these?
Fish: Mm-hmm.
SpongeBob: Now, with the addition of two, count 'em two, marshmallows. (SpongeBob tries to lift it but rips his pants instead. Everyone laughs)
Indigo Fish: Hahahahahaha. That was too funny. You are hilarious.
Sandy: Ain't he the funniest sponge you ever saw.
Larry: Anybody up for some volleyball? (Larry spikes the ball over the net and everyone cheers. SpongeBob gives it a try, next)
SpongeBob: I got it! (SpongeBob hits the ball but it doesnt go anywhere) Incoming! (SpongeBob hits the ball again but it doesn’t go anywhere. The crowd gets restless so SpongeBob rips his pants again to get a laugh) Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again. (everyone laughs)
Indigo Fish: Hahahahahaha. Once again, dude, you have split my sides. Hahahahahaha.
SpongeBob: (playing Frisbee) Hey, Sandy? How about throwing it to me?
Sandy: Ok. Here it comes. (Sandy throws it and hits SpongeBob with it)
SpongeBob: I could use a hand here. (Sandy helps him get up)
Sandy: You ok, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess so. Except I ripped my pants! (SpongeBob rips his pants again and everyone laughs)
Indigo Fish: Hahahahahaha. You still got it, dude!
Ice Cream Man: May I help you?
SpongeBob: I'll take a banana split.
Ice Cream Man: Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob: That's ok. I already split my pants. Get it?
Ice Cream Man: Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob: How about ripple? (spilts his pants) No, thanks? Already got one. (Sandy laughs hysterically. Then SpongeBob walks up to a guy eating a burger) Is that a burger you're eating?
Fish: Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: You know what would go good with that?
Fish: No, what?
SpongeBob: Ripped...pants. (rips his pants then goes up to two other guys eating) Ripped pants a la mode. (rips pants again) Delivery. Did you order 20 cases of...ripped pants? (rips pants through the cardboard box)
Surfing Announcer: Surfs up in the Goo Lagoon. And here comes Larry doing his trademark layback. There goes Sandy hanging ten. Figures, that is. There goes SpongeBob... (SpongeBob is ripping his pants on his board) ...ripping his pants again. (wipes out and washes it up on shore)
Lifeguard: Oh, look, a cardboard box washed up on the beach. (looks through his telescope) Holy fish paste! It's a guy! (gets SpongeBob and flips him over. SpongeBob is unconsious.) Why-y-y? Why-y-y? Why-y-y?
Sandy: SpongeBob!
(SpongeBob has a light upon him. much like various animes)
SpongeBob: Come closer. I need...I need...
Lifeguard: What do you need?
(Sandy is sad. this is like various animes where the female character sheds a tear upon the main character or the male character's final words)
SpongeBob: ...a tailor...(The light mentioned turns off abruptly)because I ripped my pants! (no one laughs)
Sandy: That wasn't funny, SpongeBob. Ya'll had me worried sick.
Indigo Fish: Dude...
SpongeBob: C'mon SpongeBob you're losing 'em. think... Your public's waiting. Let's see... (reads list) ...lifting weights: big laugh, Frisbee in face: kills, surfing: knocks 'em dead, pretending to drown: No. C'mon think! I got it! Hey, everybody! Not ripped pants... (rips pants off) ...pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police, there's a pants thief on the loose. (no one is there) Oh, no! Everybody's gone. Even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. We blew it pants.
Pants: What do you mean we? (pants walk off)
SpongeBob: Ohh...I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?!
Female Fish: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. (touches sunburn)
SpongeBob: Ouch.
Male Fish: No, I am. I got sand in my buns. (whales comes up from under the sand)
Whale: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I lost my best friend.
All: How?
Song: Beach Band "Ripped Pants"
When I ripped (rip) my pants,


I thought that I had everybody on my side,
But I went and blew it all sky-high.
And now she won't even spare a passing glance
All just because I (rip) ripped my pants. 


When big Larry came 'round just to put him down,
SpongeBob turned into a clown,
And no girl ever wants to dance
With a fool who went and (rip) ripped his pants. 


I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse,
But the pain feels so much worse.
'Cause windin' up with no one is a lot less fun
Than a burn from the sun or sand in your buns. 


Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget,
So listen and you won't regret,
Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance,
And you won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants. (rip) 


Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy! (both hug)
Sandy: Your song is true. If you all wanna be my friend, just be yourself.
Larry: SpongeBob, that was so righteous. Will you...sign my pants?
SpongeBob: Absolutely, buddy. (SpongeBob rips his underwear while signing Larry)
(Fish whistles)
Narrator: Ah, ze early morning in Bikini Bottom, when the jellyfish are buzzing about and making their jellyfish jelly. (telescope peeks out of SpongeBob’s window) Oh, what is happening here? (SpongeBob looks through the telescope for a jellyfish) Collectors? (SpongeBob nods to Patrick that there are jellyfish around. SpongeBob jumps into a metal, square vent like contraption while Patrick jumps into a round one. Then both slide down a rope but stop before hitting the ground as their hands burn from sliding down it. After their hands cool off, they put together some nets and try them out before heading out the door. A jellyfish floats by as they stare at it and then go after it)
SpongeBob & Patrick: La la la la la! La la la la la! La la la la la!
SpongeBob: I think I’ve got it! No, wait a minute... (the jellyfish stings them both as they run away from the jellyfish)
Patrick: Go! go! go! go! go! go! (both tumble over in front of Squidward's house as the jellyfish floats by and stings them both on their bottom.)
Squidward: Humph.
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, we’re jellyfishing.
Squidward: Of course you are. Bye now. (walks away)
SpongeBob: Wait! We made a net especially for you! Do you want to come with us?
Squidward: Really? Jellyfishing with you guys? Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book. I would love to go jellyfishing! I can’t think of anything I’d like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends: SpongeBob and...uhh...
Patrick: Patrick.
Squidward: Right. But I can’t. Bye bye.
SpongeBob: Next time?
Squidward: Oh sure, right! Whatever. (rides his bike) Like that’ll ever happen.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun.
Patrick: Maybe he doesn’t like us.
SpongeBob: No, are you kidding? We’re his best friends.
Squidward: (laughs as he bikes down up and down the road) Jellyfishing! Oh, I’ll go! (laughs more) I sure had them going. (laughs more. Just then, a jellyfish floats towards Squidward direction and floats into his mouth causing him to spit it out and smack it) Stupid jellyfish! Beat it! (the jellyfish flies up Squidward's shirt causing him to lose control of his bike and falling down a cliff. Then we are shown SpongeBob gradually waiting for Squidward as he checks every so often, out the window, for Squidward's return. Then Squidward, in a wheelchair, rides down to his house wrapped up in bandages from head to toe)
SpongeBob: Squid’s back! (calls Patrick on the phone)
Patrick: Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, Squid’s home! And we’re gonna make sure he’s greeted by his two best friends!
Patrick: Oh great! Who are they?
SpongeBob: Us! (two shown talking right next to each other as they hang up) Let’s go! (Squidward rolls into his house and turns on the lights to reveal SpongeBob & Patrick with a banner hanging over them with the words 'welcome home' on it) Welcome home, Squidward!
Patrick: Merry Christmas!
SpongeBob: We’re gonna make this your best day ever! (Squidward tries to roll back out but SpongeBob grabs him and turns him around) Well, your best day’s sure not gonna be out there.
Patrick: How about some soup on your best day ever? (Squidward is rolled over to the table with the soup. Looks down at it with the words 'best day ever' spelled out) Here we go! Oh, it’s a little hot. (blows on it too hard causing it to splash on Squidward. Then Patrick notices the soup is gone and gets some more and blows it on Squidward again. He grabs some more soup and tries it again but he blows it on Squidward again. About to blow on more soup but SpongeBob stops him)
SpongeBob: I don’t think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever. (leans over to Squidward's clarinet) How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet. (blows on it but high-pitched notes blow out) Sorry, my lips are a little dry. (licks his lips for few seconds and reattempts to play the clarinet but Patrick takes it away)
Patrick: Music isn’t best either.
SpongeBob: But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever (the) best day ever! (at Jellyfish Fields)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Jellyfishing! jellyfishing! jellyfishing~ jellyfishing! jellyfishing! jellyfishing! jellyfishing! jellyfishing! jellyfishing!
SpongeBob: This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured. (Squidward tries to get away but SpongeBob stops him again) No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you’re eager, Squid, but you don’t even have your net. Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen.
Patrick: Firmly grasp it in your hand. (puts the net handle on Squidward's hand and lets go but it falls to the ground) Firmly grasp it. (puts the net handle on Squidward's hand and lets go but it falls to the ground) Firmly grasp it!!!! (shoves the net into Squidward's hand making a huge hole in the bandages and making Squidward scream in pain) That oughta do it.
SpongeBob: (points to a jellyfish) There’s one in position. Ready...set...go!
SpongeBob & Patrick: Go Squid! You got it! Go, Squidward, go! (Squidward doesn't move)
Patrick: I think we better show him how it’s done.
SpongeBob: Da, da, da, da, dum. (both jump two steps forward) Da, da, da, da, dum. (both jump forward two steps again) Da, da, da, da, dum. (Patrick tries capturing the jellyfish but falls onto the ground)
Patrick: Da, da, da, da, dum. (both try to capture the jellyfish)
Jellyfish: Bz, bz, bz, bz, buz.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Da, da, da, da, dum.
SpongeBob: Da, da, da. Da, da, da, da, da, da, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum (SpongeBob & Patrick get stung by the jellyfish then the jellyfish stings Squidward's nose and Squidward gets angry and goes after the jellyfish)
SpongeBob: Hey look! Squid’s doing it! (Squidward's wheelchair gets stopped by a rock but he continues on and captures the jellyfish. Then he bangs his net on the pink look-a-like rock. Then the rock raises above the ground and is a big jellyfish which hovers over Squidward)
Patrick: This guy’s good.
SpongeBob: He’s a natural! (SpongeBob & Patrick cheer for Squidward on)
Patrick: See what you've been missing?! (as Squidward tries to get away from the Jellyfish Queen)
SpongeBob: You've got 'em now!
Patrick: It's in the bag!
SpongeBob: This really is your best day ever, isn't it? (Squidward gets zapped big time by the jellyfish)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Oohhh!!!! (Next, we're shown SpongeBob & Patrick, with band-aids on, walking around in front of the easter island head) Hey Patrick. Well, thought yesterday went pretty well, don’t you think?
Patrick: I had fun.
SpongeBob: Me too.
Patrick: Here comes Squidward!
SpongeBob: Oh, great. (laughs nervously. Squidward rolls in on a motorized hospital bed) Hey Squid! How about that... (Squidward ignores SpongeBob and keeps going) ...best day ever?
Patrick: There’s always tomorrow! (Squidward tries to get in his house but just keeps running into his door)
SpongeBob: Umm, we’re really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward. (Squidward runs into his door again) We got you a present! (the jellyfish from yesterday is in a jar) It’s the jellyfish. (SpongeBob gives the jellyfish to Squidward)
Patrick: You know, from yesterday!
SpongeBob: You’re not still mad, are you? (Squidward opens the jar pointing towards SpongeBob & Patrick)
Patrick: Yup, he’s still mad. (jellyfish goes after SpongeBob & Patrick as Squidward laughs at what he just did. In comes the jellyfish Queen hovering over Squidward. She zaps him and Squidward's cast comes off and now in his regular attire)
Squidward: Ouch.
Squidward: One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don’t have the whole day.
SpongeBob: Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. (flips patty in air and through one of his holes)
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Next, les ingredients. Ah, whee! (catches food all around his body) Les mustard. (squirts some in eye)
Squidward: Les quit fooling around, where’s my Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Les hold on a second! (takes his head off and shakes it then puts it back on) And voila. (pulls out a Krabby Patty under Squidward's nose) It’s under your nose! (laughs)
Squidward: You’re killing me SpongeBob! Ha ha ha ha...you really are.
SpongeBob: Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs gift to all of Bikini Bottom, the Krabby Patty.
Squidward: Ok, give it to me. (patty jumps off plate and climbs all over the kitchen stuff) Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
SpongeBob: I swear, I’m not doing anything! Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! (Mr. Krabs stabs the patty with his leg)
Mr. Krabs: Alas, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Plankton: Hear me Krabs. When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I’ll run you out of business. I went to college! (picks up Plankton) Hey! Let me go!
Mr. Krabs: I’ll let you go all right, squirt. On a flying saucer! (puts Plankton on a plate throws the plate back to the Chum Bucket) Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Plankton: You’ll pay for this Krabs!
SpongeBob: Uhh...Plankton, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, he’s been trying to steal me secret formula for years. But you haven’t got it yet, have ye bug? Ok. (SpongeBob laughs) Enough lad, it wasn’t that funny. (SpongeBob laughs more) Get back to work! (stops laughing)
SpongeBob: Ok Mr Krabs, see you tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs: Good night, me boy!
Plankton: Psst...young man. (SpongeBob looks around) Yes, over here. Come on boy, a little closer. (walks forward) Closer... (walks closer) Not that close! (steps on Plankton, Plankton screams]Ahh! You blasted barnacle head! I mean, hi!
SpongeBob: Plankton? What do you want?
Plankton: I just want to talk. You could say we’re friends, right?
SpongeBob: Umm...no.
Plankton: Acquaintances?
SpongeBob: No.
Plankton: Well, we’re both invertebrates, aren’t we?
SpongeBob: I guess so.
Plankton: You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I’ve been keeping it in my secret compartment. (takes out a golden spatula) Ching! Sparkle, sparkle.
SpongeBob: Wow! A golden spatula! And its even got my name on it!
Plankton: It’s a gift! A gift from a friend. (hugs SpongeBob’s thumb) Friends give each other gifts. And tomorrow is my birthday. (puts on a birthday hat and on SpongeBob’s thumb and takes out a cake) And you know what I’d like more than anything in the whole wide world? (blows out the candles)
SpongeBob: A booster seat?
Plankton: Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you my friend, is one of those tender...delicious...Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob:[gasps] You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it’s not even your birthday tomorrow.
Plankton: Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
SpongeBob: You’ll never get a Krabby Patty from me, even if we are friends! Never, never, never, never!
Plankton: Oh, I’ll get a Krabby Patty and you’re going to hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! (takes out a record player and plays evil music and laughs along with it)
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
(SpongeBob goes to sleep then Plankton jumps up as a flower on SpongeBob’s bed)
Plankton: SpongeBob, you will be mine! (pulls out the record player and laughs with it but instead it plays the ABC’s. Plankton flips the record and laughs again then pulls out a map of a brain while in SpongeBob’s head) It should be in here somewhere...but where? (standing on the brain) Where? Oh. This will be the beginning of the end! (SpongeBob turns over on his left side and the brain rolls over Plankton) Ouch! Stupid brain. Come back here you swine! (SpongeBob rolls around a couple more times until the brain stops and Plankton tapes it down) That’s it brain, you’re going down! Yes, yes, that’s grand. (takes out some blueprints) And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan. (Plankton puts the antenna in SpongeBob’s brain) And now it’s time for a little wakey-uppy. (Plankton touches the 'total control' button with his foot that tells SpongeBob to wake up)
SpongeBob: Morning already? (Plankton shifts the controls to where SpongeBob’s legs are at his side) I...I feel a little funny today.
Plankton: I have you now! (SpongeBob walks to the kitchen)
SpongeBob: Time for a well-balanced breakfast. (crashes through the wall and through the fridge) This isn’t what I had in mind. (walks toward his pants) Let me just grab my pants. (runs into pants but doesn’t put them on) I guess I’m not wearing any pants today. (crashes through the wall) I guess I’m not using the door either. See you later Gary…I guess.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You’re right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! Squidward! Help!
Squidward: Be quiet, SpongeBob! (crashes through Squidward’s wall)
SpongeBob: Help!
Squidward: SpongeBob! What are you doing? I’m talking to you! SpongeBob! (SpongeBob crashes through the opposite wall then turns head) SpongeBob, are you mad?
Plankton: Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
Squidward: Mediocre?
Plankton: You pretentious little insignificant artist. Your snidely creations are worth less than a protozoa’s waste!
SpongeBob: Something must be wrong with my brain! (rolls his eyes to the back of his head and notices Plankton) Plankton! What kind of friend are you?
Plankton: Nonsense. You never liked me anyway. You wouldn’t even come to my birthday party!
SpongeBob: Get out of my head! Leave me brain alone! Never! Never! (laughs evilly and walks out backwards. SpongeBob walks through Patrick’s rock and then onto the Krusty Krab)
Plankton: How about a little take-out!
SpongeBob: No, never! You can’t fool me Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula! (walks into the Chum Bucket)
Plankton: You are going to hand it over to me personally!
SpongeBob: No, no, no! There’s no one here.
Plankton: Don’t remind me. Brace yourself SpongeBob, this is my lab! (walks into a room with a video of a Labrador Retriever then walk into Plankton's laboratory) And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? (pulls it out and plays dramatic music)
SpongeBob: I must fight! (tries to break free but can’t)
Plankton: No, no, no. There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. (a mechanical arm puts in some seaweed in the analyzer)
Computer: Seaweed: 50% Sea; 50% Weed. (picture of the seaweed appears)
Plankton: Impressed? Now let’s reveal that secret formula. (pulls the lever forward making a couple of SpongeBob’s fingers slip off) And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty. (more fingers let go of the patty) This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants?
SpongeBob: I just have to say I’m sorry I let Mr Krabs down. I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, you delicate little Krabby Patty.
Plankton: Mmm.
SpongeBob: With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness.
Plankton: Steamy... (a real patty is shown being created)
SpongeBob: I’ll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. (Plankton drools)
Plankton: Yes…yes…yes!! (jumps at the patty) Come to poppa! (Plankton bounces off the patty and goes in the analyzer) Oh boy.
Computer: Plankton: 1% Evil, 99% Hot Gas. (shows Plankton on the screen)
Plankton: Well this stinks.
SpongeBob: Well patty, I guess we can go home now.
Plankton: SpongeBob, that’s my Krabby Patty! (SpongeBob walks out and the doors swing open and close a few times) Give it back you porous freak! I command you! My patty! No!! I’ll settle for some fries.
Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. Congratulations, chef! (gets dressed off screen by taking a shower, gargling, and brushing his teeth. Comes out in a tuxedo and sits down but he hears giggling coming from outside. He goes to check on it and notices SpongeBob and Patrick playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into the bubble and it floats right next to Patrick's head and pops) SpongeBob Bubble: Hi Patrick. (Patrick giggles as he whispers into a bubble and sends it over to SpongeBob where it pops)
Patrick Bubble: Hi SpongeBob. (SpongeBob giggles as Squidward gets irritated and makes a bubble of his own from the liquid of his soufflé. SpongeBob whispers into another bubble) SpongeBob: (whispering into bubble) Patrick, you’re my best friend in the whole neighborhood. (bubble floats over but is interrupted when Squidward whispers into his "bubble". Squidward's bubble pops SpongeBob's bubble by kicking it. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops)
Squidward Bubble: Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know. (Patrick frowns then sends a bubble over to SpongeBob)
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: (whispering into the bubble) Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. (bubble floats over to Patrick and pops. Then another bubble floats back over to SpongeBob)
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well I think you’re ugly. (another bubble comes over and pops) Yellow is ugly! (2 other bubbles, but smaller, floats over and pops and gives SpongeBob a raspberry.)
SpongeBob: (whispering into the bubble) Patrick, what are you talking about? (bubble floats over to Patrick. One of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops)
Squidward Bubble: SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. (SpongeBob gasps) You give bottom dwellers a bad name. (Squidward creates a bunch more. One floats over to SpongeBob) If I had a dollar for every brain you don’t have, I’d have one dollar. (Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick) Hey Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop...as some newspaper!
Patrick: (stands up and yells at SpongeBob) Well that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: (stands up and yells at Patrick) Yeah, well that means that, uhh...so are you!
Patrick: Well, you’re a turkey!
SpongeBob: What’s that? (at this point, Squidward comes out with a lawn chair and his soufflé)
Patrick: It’s what you are!
SpongeBob: Well you’re a bigger one!
Patrick: Well you’re still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah? Well it doesn’t matter what you call me, ‘cause I never wanna see you again anyway! (SpongeBob goes back inside through the back door and turns around) Aww, tarter sauce! (shuts door as Patrick opens his rock and slams it on himself and comes up all squished and sounding like an accordion. Squidward laughs a lot and puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth. He chokes on the fork and turns a deeper shade of blue as the letter "K" appears in his left eye and the letter "O" appears in his right eye and flashes appears. Squidward passes out)
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you’re choking! (runs over to Squidward) Uhh...uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. (takes a big, deep breath and does CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick grabs it) I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You’re a real lifesaver, friend! (shakes Patrick's hands)
Patrick: Friend? (holds Squidward) Friend...
Squidward: Yeah, Patrick, we’re friends (steps back),just friends. (both notice SpongeBob in his window gazing down with a blank stare)
Patrick: So what’re we gonna do tonight, best friend? (walks with Squidward over to the Easter island head)
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They’re no fun anyway, right, Gary? Gary? (knocks on his shell)
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: (sitting on a bench as he claps) Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! (Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note but Patrick falls asleep as soon as he starts playing. Squidward gets angry)
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! (holds up three fingers) Uhh... (draws faces on each finger) The gangs all here... (starts to cry as we see Squidward dragging Patrick, still asleep, outside. Squidward breaks his back after dragging Patrick a few feet)
Squidward: My back! I threw out my back! (SpongeBob notices)
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, now’s my chance! (jumps out the window)
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: (running) Don’t worry, Squidward! I’m coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I’ll save you! (SpongeBob rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath. Squidward tries to get to his door)
Squidward: No, no! Get away from me! No, no! (SpongeBob jumps off a diving board)
SpongeBob: Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! (screaming as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place) Oh! I’m ruined! I'm...I’m...I’m...I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You’re a real friend! (SpongeBob smiles big)
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn’t mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don’t worry, Squidy old pal. That’s what friends are for. (Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter island head) So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I’ve been playing bassinet for years! (he takes one from the wall) Give me an A, buddy
Music: Squidward, My Friend
Squidward is my best friend in the world.
Squidward is my best friend in the sea.
Squidward likes Patrick more than SpongeBob.
And Patrick is a dirty stinky, rotten filthy friend stealer!




SpongeBob: Umm, I can fix this. (Squidward is steaming red and throws SpongeBob out) So, uhh, I’ll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. (opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub)
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. (shows him a brush and soap)
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! (SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window)
SpongeBob: What’s the matter, Squidward, old buddy? (notices Patrick in the bath-tub) Oh, ho-ho, so this is what I find, huh? My best friend and my ex-best friend and... (shown bath toys) …rubber bath toys! (SpongeBob & Patrick argue as Squidward runs away)
Squidward: Ahh! This can’t be happening to me!
SpongeBob & Patrick: Squidward?!
SpongeBob: Buddy?!
Patrick: Squidward?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: (in a trash-can) Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and out of my hair!
SpongeBob: (reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it) Squidward. (opens it) A dinner party? I’d love to! (SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it) Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. (shuts door)
SpongeBob: I’d much rather dine with you than that lousy... (gasps when he sees Patrick) Say, what gives? I’m not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob & Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: (takes out a bottle of soda) Well, how about some soda, guys? (SpongeBob shows him his glass)
SpongeBob: Yes, please! (Squidward gives him some soda) Thanks, friend. (flicks Squidward's nose)
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? (SpongeBob gets the soda instead of Patrick)
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! (drinks)
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! (pours SpongeBob another glass)
Patrick: I still didn’t get any! (SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda)
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! (Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast)
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward! (shows Squidward his glass again but it's still full) Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick, your glass is full.
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
SpongeBob: (shows Squidward his glass) Squidward!
Patrick: (shows Squidward his glass) Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob & Patrick: (both show Squidward their glass) Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I’m all out of pop. I’m gonna go get some more. (walks away) Why don’t you just stay here and chat? (closes door. Then we are shown SpongeBob and Patrick not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door. Then a crashing sound is heard) I should just walk away right now. (opens door to find his house destroyed) What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? (pieces around the door break)
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? (both hug)
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great. Go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don’t you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: NO! Out! (both walk out)
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he’s jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. (Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around the door falls on his back)
Squidward: Oh, my back!
SpongeBob: (SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off) This is it, Gary!
Gary: Meow. (SpongeBob’s bed bounce up and flings SpongeBob at the calendar where he lands on March 3rd with the words 'boating exam today!' on it then drops to the floor) The big boating exam is today! I’ve never felt so capable! (door opens from underneath him. Comes out of his house riding a bike) I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready. Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I’m ready, Squidward! (SpongeBob rides his unicycle around Squidward's house)
Squidward: Ready to move?
SpongeBob: No, I’m ready to pass my boating test. (rides his bike towards the school) I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready… (stops his bike near a dumpster and jumps off of it) I’m ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well pal, I won’t be needing you anymore. (throws the bike into the dumpster) I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Citizen: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!
SpongeBob: (snaps fingers) Hey, I’m getting mine next!
Citizen: Hey, I doubt it! (walks off)
SpongeBob: Ok, see you on the road. I’m ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready(jumps around the boardwalk)
Mrs. Puff: (sighs) I’m not ready. (opens the door)
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I’m going to pass my boating exam!
Mrs. Puff: (with clipboard and pen in hand) We’ll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Mrs. Puff: I know. Ok, #1: What is the front of the boat?
SpongeBob: The bow. (Mrs. Puff writes down his answer)
Mrs. Puff: What is the back?
SpongeBob: Stern. (Mrs. Puff writes down his answer)
Mrs. Puff: #3: Right is…
SpongeBob: Starboard. Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. (Mrs. Puff writes down his answers)
Mrs. Puff: You’ve past the oral test. What a surprise! (gets in the boat and secures herself tightly) Now it’s time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Ok, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? (looks at his watch) Is it time already?
Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. (gets in)
Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track. (looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer) Ok, SpongeBob, what’s the first thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to start the boat. (Mrs. Puff turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy) SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it’s only the boat.
SpongeBob: The boat?
Mrs. Puff: Ok, now what do you do next?
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: Yes...no, no! Don’t floor it.
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: No, no, don’t, don’t floor it.
SpongeBob: Ok, floor it.
Mrs. Puff: No! No! (SpongeBob pushes the accelerator down and starts driving backwards really fast by some spectators and drives into a building. After crashing, Mrs Puff becomes big & round)
Mrs. Puff: (deep voice) Oh, SpongeBob, why?
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: (in his bed) I don’t know why, Gary. I don’t know. I’m tired of failing that boating test. I’ve already taken it thirty-seven times.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Ok, thirty-eight. (puts his pillow on his head)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I’m not walking.
Patrick: (over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob’s bed) SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
SpongeBob: (through walkie-talkie) What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob: (through walkie-talkie) Oh, Patrick, I’m not in the mood.
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Get out of bed. (SpongeBob gets out of bed)
SpongeBob: (through walkie-talkie) Ok, now what, Patrick?
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Go to your closet for a surprise. (SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door)
SpongeBob: (through walkie-talkie) Ok, I’m at the closet.
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Listen carefully. What’s pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob: (through walkie-talkie) I don’t know, Patrick. (SpongeBob opens the closet door and Patrick has one of SpongeBob’s square pants on)
Patrick: Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Pat, don’t do that. (sits in a chair) I’ve got too much to worry about.
Patrick: What’s the problem?
SpongeBob: I can’t pass my boating exam. I’ve taken it thirty-seven...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers... (Patrick's square pants rip off) ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I’ll do all the thinking for you. (takes SpongeBob’s walkie-talkie)
SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? (Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob’s head with the antenna coming out of the top)
Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I’m taking the test, you can give me all the answers. (SpongeBob notices the antenna sticking out) Wait a minute, Patrick. Won’t I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? (Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob’s upstairs window)
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing. (looking through the telescope at SpongeBob) Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! Testing!! (yells) Testing! Ah! Test. Do you read?!
SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Got your apple ready? (SpongeBob shows an apple) Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on. (Patrick focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word 'lucky' on the top of it) Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You’re ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. (SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and on the ground and starts chewing grass)
SpongeBob: Moo.
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) No, no, get in the boat! (SpongeBob jumps in the boat. A siren is heard as Mrs. Puff comes out an ambulance and into the boat) Give her the apple. (SpongeBob gives her the apple)
SpongeBob: Here you go, ma’am. (Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows)
Mrs. Puff: Let’s get this over with. (takes a deep breath) What’s the first thing you do? (puts hands and arms over head for protection)
SpongeBob: Uhh...
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Start the boat. (SpongeBob pushes a button that starts the boat causing Mrs. Puff to go crazy)
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob: It’s ok, it’s only the boat.
Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob: I...I think so.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well...what’s the second thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) No, no, put it in drive.
SpongeBob: Put it in drive?
Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! (SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive) Put it in drive. Then what?
SpongeBob: (lifts leg up) Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: No! Ahh! No-o-o.
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Freeze, mister! (SpongeBob stops) Big toe. (SpongeBob’s big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down)
Mrs. Puff: Oh gracious. Oh gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven’t crashed yet.
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Ok, you’re coming to your first turn. (giant wall with the word 'wall' on it is shown and a left curve)
Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn.
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Left. (SpongeBob turns left)
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
Patrick: (through walkie-talkie) Right. (SpongeBob turns right)
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You’re doing fine. (SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of square pants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob’s diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob’s fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down) Splendid! Wonderful! (sign that reads 'finish line' is just ahead) There’s the finish line. It’s unbelievable. You’ve shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I’ve ever seen. What’s your secret? A little radio in your head? (everyone laughs) Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? (everyone laughs) And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? (everyone laughs) Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. (SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating)
Patrick: Haha! Cheating! Haha! Haha!
SpongeBob: I’m cheating. Mrs Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil?
SpongeBob: I think I’m cheating.
Mrs. Puff: What’s that, dear? (SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff)
SpongeBob: I think I am cheating!
Mrs. Puff: You've...you’ve let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat. (shows antennae under hat) There is a guy giving me all the answers. It’s all true! (crying) I’m cheating! I’m cheating! I’m cheating!
Patrick: What? (Patrick runs out of SpongeBob’s house and back under his rock)
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Mrs. Puff: The wheel, SpongeBob. The wheel...
SpongeBob: Cheating...I'm a cheater. Cheater...
Mrs. Puff: No, no, no. It's quite alright, you can cheat.
SpongeBob: No...I'm cheating!
Mrs. Puff: At least, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Cheating.
Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater.
Mrs. Puff: It's ok to cheat today!
SpongeBob: No...
Mrs. Puff: That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: Cheater.
Mrs. Puff: (manly voice) Oh, SpongeBob, why?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I’m sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: It’s ok, SpongeBob, you didn’t mean it. Ok, boys, take me away. (EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance)
SpongeBob: Don’t worry, Mrs. Puff. I’ll try harder next semester. (Mrs. Puff screams as she is taken away by the ambulance) It’ll be great! (walks away) Only now I don’t even have my bike.
Gary: (with SpongeBob’s bike) Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! (rides away on his bike) Alright, let’s go surprise someone at the hospital!
Squidward: Hurry up with those chairs SpongeBob, it's after closing and I'd like to go home. (phone rings)
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it, coming. (leaps for the phone but Squidward answers it first)
Squidward: Hello? Sorry, sir, we're close... (Mr. Krabs snatches phone)
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you? (customer explains order over phone) Pizza? (eyes turn into dollar signs) Of course we have pizza.
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery Squid will bring it right over. (hangs up)
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. (Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza) We don't deliver.
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver, but you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. (SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big)
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end...check. Antenna...check. Bumper...check. Bumper sticker... (bumper sticker says"I Brake FoR SeA URchins") ...check. (un-caps the tire pressure and inhales a little) Tire pressure... (blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face) ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty pizza ever.
Squidward: Good, then you drive.
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: All right, back it up. (tries to move the stick shift down)
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay.
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse. (words turn into Korean)
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: (shifts gears) Back it up! (boat backs up really fast)
Squidward: Give me the wheels, SpongeBob! Give me the wheels!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! (boat eventually stops with no fuel left)
Squidward: Well...You backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse? (kicks boat and the boat starts up again and goes forward fast back to the KK)
SpongeBob: Well, we can still deliver it on foot. (both walk on the sand)
Squidward: Ow, ow ow.
SpongeBob: (singing) The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...And my feet are killing me. Whoa. (trips over SpongeBob) SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: (rubbing ground) It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: (pointing to the road) Truck! Sixteen wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. (starts dancing in the road)
Truck Driver: Crashin' Fashion Break Dancers!
Squidward: He's stopping! He's stopping! (Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck)
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. (SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds)
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?
SpongeBob: I can't, it's for the customer.
Squidward: Who cares about the customer?
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: (wind stops and SpongeBob gasps) Squidward! (starts flying again)
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! (runs over Squidward)
Squidward: (holding SpongeBob’s legs) SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No, it's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza! (lifts up into the tornado) SpongeBob! (looks down) Hang onto the pizza! (tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground) Hey! Hey! Where's the road? We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go? What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. (points)
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? (SpongeBob nods) So, let me get this straight...you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: Yep
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. (heads the other way)
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. (shows a town in the other direction)
SpongeBob: (sings) The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza absolutivally. (later, both lying down face down in the sand)
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. (Squidward eats some coral) No, maybe it wasn't coral.(Squidward spits out the coral) Maybe it was sand, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it was for the customer.
Squidward: You're right! It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. (opens box)
SpongeBob: Okay, it's fine.
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. (opens box) Oh, no I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine looking pizza.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Oh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do Squidward. I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away!
Squidward: Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait!
SpongeBob: No! (runs into Squidward)
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over: one way or another.
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved, now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved!
Squidward: Will you cut that out?! That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder; It's a rock! A ro-o-o-ock. (starts to cry) The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers? Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... (SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder) ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro.
SpongeBob: I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face! (rings doorbell)
Tom: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Tom: Wow, thanks, I've been dying for one of these. Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: What drink?
Tom: My drink! My diet Dr. Kelp. Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: (checks through the order) But, you didn't order any...
Tom: How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?
SpongeBob: But...but...
Tom: Didn't you ever once think of the customer? (gives the pizza back) You call yourself a delivery boy? Well, I ain't buying! (closes door)
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? (SpongeBob starts crying like a baby) Sponge? (Squidward gets angry and takes a try at the customer)
Tom: Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!
Squidward: Well, this one's on the house! (throws pizza in face of Tom)
SpongeBob: (starting to stop crying) Did he change his mind?
Squidward: He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: No drink?
Squidward: Nah. Now take me home. (jumps up on the rock)
SpongeBob: Are you kidding, we have just enough time to make it back to work. (backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab)
Squidward: Work? Oh, my aching tentacles!
Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking.
Nematode #1: Hungry!
Nematodes: Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. (all eat some coral) Nematode #1: Still hungry!
Nematodes: still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry. (eat a car that drives by)
Fred: Aww, dang nematodes!
Nematode #1: Thirsty!
Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. (all bounce to SpongeBob’s house and take out straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as everything begins to shrink inside, even Gary’s bowl)
Gary: Meow. (SpongeBob’s bed begins to shrink as he wakes up)
SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We’re finally huge!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no! (squeezes through the doors as he tries to get to the phone. Gary gets stuck in a door.) Shell phone! I’ll call Squidward. He’ll know what to do!
Squidward: (answers phone) Hello?
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
SpongeBob: (as he talks to Squidward, his voice gets higher and higher until the phone completely disappears) Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller...oh no!
Squidward: Yep, it is. (Patrick comes out from his rock)
Patrick: Is it time, already, to ruin Squid’s day? (falls off rock onto his furniture then jumps out with a tuxedo on) Hey, SpongeBob, don’t start without me! (SpongeBob’s house gets sucked up by the nematodes. Then the nematodes leave)
SpongeBob: Ohh...nematodes. (sees a seed on the ground) The only thing left of my house is this little pebble.
Squidward: What’s going on here?
SpongeBob: I’ve got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It’s gone! It’s all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
Squidward: (excited) Yeah...
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squidward: Well, what can I say? (begins to shake SpongeBob’s hand) It’s been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. (starts to walk back into his Easter Island head) I’m gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. (party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he parties) Boo-hoo! (starts to laugh)
Patrick: Squid’s taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
SpongeBob: I guess I’ll have to move back with my mom and dad. (shown a picture of SpongeBob’s parents smiling)
Patrick: No, wait a minute, no you don’t. (shown picture of SpongeBob’s parents frowning) We can build you a new house!
SpongeBob: We can’t build a house!
Patrick: Well, sure, it’s easy! I built my house all by myself! (antenna on Patrick's rock falls off)
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, let’s get to work! (shows SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers. As SpongeBob tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick flying upside-down then back into the ground. SpongeBob is nailing pieces of wooden boards together and a piece would fall off and land on Patrick's fingers. Then Patrick would move his board under the next board that would fall off. Next, shown SpongeBob’s finished house and Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb)
Patrick: We’re done!
SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think?
Patrick: I wish I lived there.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: No. (Sponge puts the pineapple on his head)
SpongeBob: One bedroom. (nose flips through the door and pineapple breaks into pieces)
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob: Well, looks like we’ve got to move back with mom and pop.
Patrick: Well, you can’t move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
SpongeBob: That’d be great!
Patrick: Yeah! We’ll be rock mates! (SpongeBob and Patrick are sleeping under Patrick's rock) Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, rock mate.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. (SpongeBob goes to sleep but then is awaken to Patrick's snoring) Oh...what the...? (Gary hides in his shell from the noises of Patrick's snoring & SpongeBob puts in a cork in the sides of his head and goes back to sleep. The wind blows and Patrick pulls the rock closer to him and SpongeBob pulls it back. This goes back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold so he covers himself with the sand on the ground and goes to sleep. Patrick's drooling makes its way over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat Sponge. He walks over to Patrick and then removes the corks down-sizing him to a normal Sponge. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick spits out the cork)
Patrick: Spiders! (lifts rock and starts hitting SpongeBob with it until he goes back to sleep. SpongeBob walks away from the rock a few feet and goes back to sleep. A few moments later, Patrick hits SpongeBob a few times with the rock, again. Then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob walks over to Squidward's house where Squidward is still sleeping)
SpongeBob: (tapping Squidward's nose as he whispers) Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: H-h-huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Huh? Wha-what?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Squidward: Yeah, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks Squidward. (gets in bed with Squidward) Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
Squidward: Hmm, yeah, sure. (scoots over to the side)
SpongeBob: While you’re at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Squidward: Ok. Hmmm, yeah, sure. (he walks off to get some water for SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. (Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass of water) Thanks, buddy.
Squidward: Y-you’re welcome. (SpongeBob drinks the water)
SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Squidward: Yeah. Me, too.
SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: (yawns) Good night, SpongeBob. (Squidward opens his eyes to realize SpongeBob is in his bed. Next, we're shown Squidward showing SpongeBob out the door) Good night, SpongeBob. (the next day, Squidward opens his eyes excitedly) T-t-t-today’s the big day, Squidward! Don’t wanna be late! (gets dressed and heads outside) Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! (SpongeBob, with suitcases, and Patrick are standing outside waiting for SpongeBob’s parents to arrive) I do not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can’t believe it’s really happening.
SpongeBob: Don’t worry, Squidward. I’ll come visit you.
Squidward: Don’t try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. Please.
SpongeBob: Here come my parents. (Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds)
Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we’re here!
Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry hurry son, your mother has dinner waiting.
SpongeBob: Hi, mom.
Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags.
SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. (walks back to where his house used to be) I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. (buries it into the ground) You hold too many memories. (a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it and then glows. Then shakes Squidward's hand) Well, Squidward, this is good-bye. (walks away)
Squidward: Good-bye, SpongeBob, good-bye.(dances) Good-bye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Good-bye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Good-bye, good-bye.
SpongeBob: (Patrick is crying) Good-bye, Patrick. Good-bye, Bikini Bottom. (Patrick hangs onto the back of the boat still crying)
Squidward: (still dancing) SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving. (the seed grows some roots) SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving... (seed grows a vine and comes out of the ground and drops a pineapple where SpongeBob’s old house used to be on top of Squidward. The vine then goes back into the ground)
SpongeBob: My house is back! (SpongeBob, his parents, & Patrick all excitedly go back into the pineapple) Aww, Squid, isn’t this great? I’m back forever!
Squidward: Forever?
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and Forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil.
Villain: Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool.
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Champion of the Deep.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
SpongeBob: (dressed up as Mermaid Man) Come, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
Patrick: (dressed up as Barnacle Boy) Leaping' Lampreys, Mermaid Man. I'm right behind you.
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
Squidward: SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You know what this means.
Patrick: Donuts.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Ooohh.
SpongeBob: By the power of Neptune. (Patrick bites into the donut)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Unite!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! (both go into deep thinking) Think...harder...Barnacle Boy. (jellyfish swims by) Here they come. (Squidward blows jellyfish away)
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
Squidward: (under a tent) What the? Ohh! RAGA...
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping Jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield. (Squidward is destroying The 'Shield')
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man.
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend.
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah...now please leave me alone.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy reunite! (Patrick now has 3 bites)
(At Shady Shoals Retirement Home)
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Manager: Undercover? Yeah...well I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. (SpongeBob and Patrick laughing as they walk in) There they are. Right over there. (SpongeBob and Patrick gasp)
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: (holding onto SpongeBob) Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! (SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV)
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
(SB And Pat Are giggling)
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
(Patrick and SB Gasp.)
SpongeBob: But you can't retire! There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: Wha? what Evil. EVIL! Barnacle Boy! Don't Forget, there's evil!
SpongeBob: All I said that there was evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: EVIL! EEEEEEEEEEE! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
Mermaid Man: (hanging on a water fountain) EVIL! EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, BAAAAH! (water squirts at Mermaid Man) Disgrace! (manager picks SpongeBob and Patrick up and throws them out)
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. (captain gives a thumbs up) The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. (fireworks appear)
Patrick: Ooh! Pretty lights!
(At The home's cafeteria)
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! To the broccoli! Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Cafeteria Lady: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, away!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us.
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He...he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut...will you stop calling me 'boy'?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invited a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. (Pretends to shoot) And he globs on the undersea Dome! (Splats on table) And then he starts sucking on the glass. (Sucks up his saliva)
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Manager: What is going on in here?
Mermaid Man: You may kiss the bride! (SpongeBob gets kicked out)
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married.
(Back at the retirement home)
Mermaid Man: Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
SpongeBob: (dressed up as a woman) Oh, my. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: (dressed up as the A robber) Hold it right there, ma’am. I'll be taking that.
SpongeBob: Aah! Help! Help! Help!
Patrick: It's working.
SpongeBob: Why, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when he's disturbed.
(MM Has his eyes wide open)
SpongeBob: Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him.
Mermaid Man: Stop shoutin'. I'm napping!!
Barnacle Boy: It’s not me, you ol' coot!
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here.
(MM & BB Are arguing)
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boat mobile.
Barnacle Boy: Gah! Yeah, but. It's suppose to be invisible. That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. Time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: EVIL! Where is it?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! (points at SB & Pat) You know what this means? (opens up box with shiny rings)
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother. (puts ring on Mermaid Man and then they put them together) Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy UNITE! Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob & Patrick: Waterball! Waterball! (Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob)
Patrick: Hehehehehe.
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man:He's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge.
Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: Dog paddle, away!
Patrick: It's the waging whirlpool. (SB and Pat cheer)
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, UNITE! (sea creatures are retired so they come slowly)
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures, attack!
SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. (sea creatures pick up SB & Pat) Mission accomplished, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah, we did it. (sea creatures throw them out)
Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel 5 years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot.
Mermaid Man: Who are you?
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. (Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy play checkers when phone rings)
Mermaid Man: It's the Aqua phone! What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello? ("HANG UP" appears) The phone is still broken. Remind me to get that fixed. ("SIT" appears)
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phones fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: It's all thanks to you. (SpongeBob winks)
WINK!
Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Customer: Hmmm...uhh...oh, I’ll have a... (Squidward takes out pencil and paper) ...no. (Squidward puts pencil and paper away) Maybe... (takes out pencil and paper) ...no. (Squidward puts pencil and paper away) Hmmm...I’ll have... (takes out pencil and paper) ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering (today), sir?
Customer: I'll have a Krabby Patty. (Squidward writes down order)
Squidward: How original.
Customer: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren’t we? (takes order and shows SpongeBob) One Krabby Patty, extra onions. (SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders)
SpongeBob: One cryin’ Johnny comin’ up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, (extra) onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin’ Johnny! Up! (rings bell)
Squidward: Whatever. (another customer comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob) Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! (SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate)
SpongeBob: One dozen cryin’ cows on the farm! Up! (Squidward takes the plate)
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. (at customer) It’s been a thrill serving you.
Customer #2: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We’re all out.
Customer #2: Could you check?
Squidward: No... (A Fish walks up to order) Let me guess, Tiny, a small salad?
Dark Green Fish: I’ll take a Double Triple Barfy Deluxe on a raft, 4x4, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. (Squidward gives up writing all of that down)
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. (SpongeBob shows Squidward he's already gotten the order done)
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. (gasps) Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: (pushes Squidward away) Squarepants. I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: (staring at Bubble Bass) Yep. I hear talk you’re kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well, then here ya go! (Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he plays with the krabby patty until he decides to take a bite) Well, Bubble Bass, whaddya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing...you forgot the pickles! (shows no pickles on the burger)
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don’t think so. You lose! (laughs)
SpongeBob: (checks patty for pickles) But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! (customers are disappointed) Where are those pickles? Pickles! Pickles! Pickles! (Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs but also throws Squidward out of the way)
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. (points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee')
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can’t we talk about this? (takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it)
Bubble Bass: No. (Krabs tries to take money back)
Mr. Krabs: How about a discount on restroom tokens? (Bubble Bass takes money back)
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How’s about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I’ll even put ice in it! (Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money) No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! (walks over to SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Mr.. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: (grabs SpongeBob) That two bucks is comin’ out of your paycheck! (SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor)
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! (Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen)
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin’!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Ok, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let’s see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That’s not right! (starts a new patty) Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! (tries again) Mustard down, bun stuff down d'oh, where’s the patty go? (tries again and uses the same bun) Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I’m losin’ it! (tries again) Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun...no! (Mr. Krabs comes in) Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can’t remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don’t you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr.. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don’t worry about that. We’ve got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? (SpongeBob walks out and goes home)
SpongeBob: Mr.. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... (looks up and notices door is not there) The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing!! (Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away) Oh. (laughs) Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got me all messed up. I better get on home and rest my brain. (walks out) Uhh, which way do I live? (Mr. Krabs points the path) Of course. (laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula) No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let’s see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? (throws paper and pencil away) I am so confused! Maybe a good night’s sleep will help me get my head on straight. (at night)
SpongeBob: Oh...was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... (hits head with fist) D'oh...think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, (SpongeBob), mattress, then sheets, pillow. (gets inbetween the two mattresses) Good-night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn’t right. (he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed) Good-night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn’t right either. (SpongeBob lays down on his back) Nope. (SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder) Nuh-uh. (tries sleeping with a mattress on his head) Negative. )tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses) C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. (tries in the the lifesaver) Wrong. (keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is under all three mattresses on the floor) Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! (picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off.) (at Krusty Krab)
Squidward: (there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher) Patties are done. (Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated)
Customer #3: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Customer #4: He burnt my fries.
Customer #5: He burnt my shake. (everyone leaves)
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! No! Arrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back! (Mr. Krabs is at SpongeBob's house when he notices a toaster nailed to the door. He opens the door and walks in) SpongeBob? (the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite) SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin’ funny, lad? (takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head)
SpongeBob: I anything can’t do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you’ll be back makin’ Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don’t ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. (walks off)
Mr. Krabs: But you’re fine, me boy! (SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door) Ohh...uhh, well...maybe not. (walksinto the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table) All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. (chuckles)
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It’s like riding a bike. You never forget! (notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove) Uhh...I’m gonna help ya! (shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room) If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. (takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don’t know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. (SpongeBob thinks of the krabby patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down)
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. (Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping till SpongeBob wakes him up) I got it! I got it! It’s all very clear to me now, Mr.. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can’t do it! I can’t do it, Mr. Krabs! I’m a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don’t talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don’t you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate! I can’t make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! (makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients) I can’t put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! (notices the patty he just made)
Mr. Krabs: (squinting his eyes at SpongeBob) It’s time. (at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter through the double doors. SpongeBob walks back into the kitchen and shoves Squidward out. Then grabs a fire extinguisher and sprays it at Squidward's back. A fish walks by)
Citizen: Hey, SpongeBob’s back! (everyone enters the Krusty Krab after hearing the good news. SpongeBob looks at his reflection in a spatula. Bubble Bass enters and pushes the crowd away)
Bubble Bass: I hear Squarepants is back. (SpongeBob opens the kitchen door)
SpongeBob: I’m right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. (spits a loogie into a bucket)
SpongeBob: This is where I belong. (blows a bubble. Bubble Bass screams) Rawr. (customers gasp as Bubble Bass holds up a knife and fork and SpongeBob holds up a spatula. We are then shown the customers, a sweaty Mr. Krabs, and Squidward looking at himself in a mirror. Squidward sees everyone looking at him and puts mirror away.)
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular. And this time, don’t forget the pickles. (SpongeBob rushes off into the kitchen to make it and quickly comes back out with his spatula twirling in his hands)
SpongeBob: I didn’t. (Bubble Bass takes a bite out of the patty. Then we are shown a sweaty Mr. Krabs & Squidward looking at himself in the mirror again. He sees everyone looking at him and so he puts the mirror away)
Bubble Bass: Still no pickles! (everyone gasps) See? (sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it) You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants! (laughs)
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! (grabs Bubble Bass’ tongue and pulls it out) Look! (shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue) He’s been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there’s the pickles from last time too!
Evelyn: And there’s my car keys! (everyone walks up to Bubble Bass)
Bubble Bass: And there’s my ride! (runs out the Krusty Krab)
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip!
Customers: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
Customers: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
Customers: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone! Squidward! (Squidward smiles) Hip hip!
Customers: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip!
Customers: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip!
Customers: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip!
Customer #6: Boo! You stink!
Narrator: Mrs. Puff’s Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it’s time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! (SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air) Let’s see here. This week's hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... (gasps) ...SpongeBob. (SpongeBob moves his desk between 2 rows) It's Jimmy! Jimmy’s the hall monitor.
Jimmy: Mrs. Puff, I’ve done it already! (SpongeBob moves his desk closer)
Mrs. Puff: Ohh...Phil?
Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. (SpongeBob moves his desk closer)
Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you’re the hall monitor.
Tina: Hey, I’ve done it three times already! (SpongeBob moves up closer)
Mrs. Puff: B-B-Beth!
Student: She graduated!
Mrs. Puff: Henry? (SpongeBob moves closer) Vera? (SpongeBob moves closer) Clayton? (SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs) Alright, I guess I have no choice. (gulps) The hall monitor of the day is SpongeBob. (SpongeBob launches into the air)
SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma’am! I am ready to assume my position...in the hall! I will protect all that are weak...in the hall! All rules will be enforced...in the hall!
Mrs. Puff: Ok! Just take the hat and belt. (tries handing him uniform)
SpongeBob: I can’t except that yet, ma’am. First I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff: You can’t make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob: Classmates!! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I’m touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... (clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech) ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! (at this point, everyone is almost asleep) Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. (takes out a long roll of paper) “Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.” (the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk) In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform (takes out the hat and belt) and assume my duties as... (puts on the uniform) ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! (walks towards the door then turns around) Oh, and I will be... (bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob)
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you ok?
SpongeBob: I overdid the speech again, didn’t I?
Mrs. Puff: I’m afraid so.
SpongeBob: Aww, tarter sauce. I guess I won’t be needing this. (takes off his uniform) I hardly knew ya. (gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened)
Mrs. Puff: Uhh...SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob: A-hoo! (dives into the uniform) Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I’ve just done? (cut to SpongeBob walking down the street. Then notices a broken traffic light)
SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who’s to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I could be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! (directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end) What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred: My leg! My leg.
SpongeBob: On patrol. I’m on patrol. (notices a house with an open window) Uh-oh, an open window. (peeks through the window and there is a couple eating) Woman: More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob: The fools. They’ve left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. (jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask) I’m the open window maniac! (both run out screaming) I hope you’ve learned a valuable lesson! (shuts the window and begins walking again) On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... (gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground) Vandals! Another crime. (takes his finger and tastes the pink goo) Strawberry. I must act! (more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream) Patrick... (looks around for the voice he just heard) Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick: My ice cream! It’s alive! (screams and throws away the ice cream)
SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it’s you. (ice cream cone is on SpongeBob’s face)
SpongeBob: Patrick. Get down here. (Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob)
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I’m down here.
Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That’s hall monitor to you!
Patrick: Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob: Sorry’s not good enough, Patrick. You’ve committed a crime, and I’m taking you in.
Patrick: What crime? (shows him the ice cream that is on the ground) I’m a bad person! (cries)
Paperboy: Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom! City paralyzed with fear! (gives one to SpongeBob) Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. (runs off) Extra! Extra!
SpongeBob: (reads paper) Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wreck? Break-in? Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can’t handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick: (still crying) I wanna be good!
SpongeBob: Hmmm...now you just need a symbol of authority. (Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head) Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you’re an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick: Hmmm...I’d get an ice cream! (both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream)
SpongeBob: Ok, now what?
Patrick: Hmmm... (both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream)
SpongeBob: This isn't working. We’ve got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! (takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy) And now, duty calls! Alright deputy, I’ll go that way, you go some different way! Run 'em out! (SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick)
Officer Durado: Afternoon, son.
Patrick: Hello, brothers. (salutes to the officers and points to his 'hat')
Officer Durado: Son, we’re looking for the maniac.
Officer Malley: Have you seen this man?! (officer #2 whips out a sign that says 'WANTED MANIAC' with SpongeBob’s picture on it. Patrick screams)
Patrick: It’s the maniac! Take him away! Take him away!
Officer Durado: Calm down son. It’s just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we’re going to show you the picture again, and you tell us if you’ve seen this guy, understand?
Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.
Officer Durado: Ok. (officer Malley shows Patrick the sign again)
Patrick: (screams) Horrible! (puts picture away. Both officers look at each other and smile. Officer #2 takes away and shows the sign to Patrick as he screams every time.)
Officer Durado: Stay indoors, son.
Officer Malley: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. (both laugh as they drive off)
Patrick: (takes out walkie-talkie) SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer.
SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick: (over walkie-talkie) I don’t wanna be a policeman anymore! I’m scared!
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself deputy.
Patrick: (over walkie-talkie) I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Poor rookie. Alright, I’m on my way back.
Patrick: Hurry SpongeBob, I think it’s getting... (day becomes night) ...dark.
SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I’ll be right there.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. (Patrick picks up the sign that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob but Patrick doesn't realize it) Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob: (over walkie-talkie) Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick: (over walkie-talkie) At the intersection of Conch and Coral. (SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign)
SpongeBob: That's where I am. He’s right on top of me, but I can’t see him! What’s he doing?
Patrick: Uhh, he’s just standing there...menacingly! (screams over walkie-talkie) Get out of there, SpongeBob! (SpongeBob screams) That’s his maniac screech. He’s going to attack! (SpongeBob runs around in circles) He’s acting all crazy! Run! Hide behind that building! (SpongeBob hides behind the building) No, he’s behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! (SpongeBob hides behind the street sign) No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light! (SpongeBob gets under the street lights) No wait, he’s there, too! Run for your life! (SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out)
SpongeBob: (over walkie-talkie) Say again, deputy?
Patrick: The maniac is in the mailbox! (SpongeBob pokes his arms and legs through the mailbox and runs through buildings and a fence)
SpongeBob: (takes a look at the 'wanted' sign) Huh, this guy’s not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I’m the maniac! (Patrick screams and a bunch of police cars surround SpongeBob)
Officer Durado: We’ll take that as a confession. (Mrs. Puff appears)
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Officer #1: You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I’m the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He’s my responsibility. (the cops stare at her) Uh-oh... (at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV) Now in conclusion, class: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I’d like to see you after class. Six months from now.
Narrator: Ah, Jellyfish Fields. Here we find SpongeBob once again stalking the wild jellyfish. SpongeBob? Hello? SpongeBob? Hmmm...he’s supposed to be here somewhere… (narrator sees a square-shaped coral) A-ha! (jellyfish floats by. SpongeBob puts his glasses on)
SpongeBob: Safety first. (SpongeBob captures a jellyfish) A-ha! I finally gotcha! (SpongeBob grabs a wooden stool and sits on it. Puts on a farmer hat and 'milks' the jellyfish. Jelly comes out and squirts on a piece of bread) Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. (walks off but jellyfish floats towards him with his glasses) Oh, my glasses! Thanks little guy! Bye. (jellyfish floats with SpongeBob) I can’t play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home. (jellyfish hangs onto SpongeBob’s nose) No, you can’t go home with me. (jellyfish walks behind SpongeBob) Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey! (puts the jellyfish on a rock) Stay! (walks backwards) Stay. (jellyfish floats around SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs the jellyfish and uses a slingshot to launch him somewhere else but the jellyfish ends up on his back. Pulls the jellyfish off) Jellyfish!, for the last time, you cannot come home with me! (jellyfish goes flat) Ahh, what the heck! (SpongeBob, with jellyfish on a rope, walk by Squidward's house) Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidward-iard! (Squidward peeks out his window) Squidward! Look at my new pet!
Squidward: That’s no pet, that’s a wild animal.
SpongeBob: No he isn’t! Watch this! (throws a stick so the jellyfish returns it. SpongeBob is holding up three fingers) How many fingers am I holding up? (jellyfish buzzes three times) Play dead! (jellyfish is buried underground with a tomb that says "R.I.P.")
Squidward: I wouldn’t let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained! (jellyfish is on a toilet reading a newspaper) I didn’t need to see that.
SpongeBob: Well, we’re going to my house to have a little fun.
Squidward: How can you possible have fun with a jellyfish? (SpongeBob and jellyfish dance to some music. Disco lights rotate around the room. SpongeBob’s house is vibrating from the music) SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish for twelve hours!
SpongeBob: (music stops) Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that’s enough for tonight. Time to go to bed. (as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on) Huh? (walks over to turn the music off) You got it all wrong, little fella. (as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on. SpongeBob turns it back off) Bed. Repeat after me. (SpongeBob ties a rope around the jellyfish) Bed! (upstairs, SpongeBob ties the rope around his bedpost) We’ll just keep you right here.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Quit worrying, Gary. He’ll be just fine. Good night everybody. (as he is sleeping, other jellyfish float inside the pineapple)
Gary: Meow. (gets squirted with jelly from all the jellyfish. It's now daytime)
SpongeBob: Good morning Gary. Good morning jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! (puts on his green robe and goes to check downstairs) Oh jellyfi... (slips on some jelly. Opens a door leading into his living room and sees jellyfish dancing to music) Where’d you all come from? (jellyfish form a figure of a hand and grab SpongeBob. They stick over a light bulb like a disco ball and spin him. Then falls to the ground) Ok, that’s it. This party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome. (As SpongeBob is walking to the stereo, jellyfish form a flight of stairs that SpongeBob walks up and falls off of) This music is way too loud. (jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a triangle) Very funny. (jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a rectangle) I’m serious! (jellyfish carry SpongeBob up and down the screen. Squidward wakes up)
Squidward: Eighteen hours! (picks up the phone and dials SpongeBob’s number) I’m going to give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind! (jellyfish picks up the phone and Squidward yells) SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears, I’ve had enough of this! (jelly squirts through the phone onto Squidward) Strawberry. (Squidward plays his clarinet outside his window) Two can play at this! (plays his clarinet badly)
SpongeBob: Come on guys, enough is enough! (jellyfish's smile turns into a frown when Squidward plays his clarinet) Uh-oh. (jellyfish sting SpongeBob) OK, I’ll talk to him! (SpongeBob peeks his head out his window) Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little better? I don’t think the jellyfish like it.
Squidward: The jellyfish don’t like-? Why sure, pal, I can play better.
SpongeBob: OK, he said he’ll play better. (Squidward turns a giant speaker towards SpongeBob pineapple then plays bad to make the jellyfish angry) Uh-oh! That’s not better! (jellyfish start knocking things over. Jellyfish float into Squidward’s house)
Squidward: Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down. (jellyfish sting Squidward and float back into SpongeBob’s house. Squidward comes later and gives SpongeBob his clarinet) Everybody’s a critic. You won’t be hearing from me anymore.
SpongeBob: Hey, now, that wasn’t nice! (jellyfish take the clarinet, break it in half, and form a fire from it and then dance around it like Indians) Ok, that is it! Everybody out! (he takes the stereo and runs toward the door but the jellyfish try to take it back. The stereo breaks into pieces and the jellyfish get angry as they start knocking stuff off and breaking it. They even sting SpongeBob) Come on Gary! (SpongeBob and Gary head up to the roof and the jellyfish follow) Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in. (Gary clicks his eyes together making a beat that the jellyfish can dance to) Huh? They stopped? (holds Gary’s eyes together and the jellyfish get angry again. Then he lets go of Gary's eyes and they dance again. Does this a couple more times and notices a trend) Gary! Don’t stop shaking it! (takes Gary to Jellyfish Fields. Along the way, SpongeBob has other creatures and things to join in the rhythm. Eventually, he gets the jellyfish back to Jellyfish Fields and he runs back home)
Narrator: Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea’s harshest lessons: wild animals can throw wild parties. (Squidward sinks down into his bubble bath) Ooh, I felt that.
SpongeBob: Hey Sandy. Hey Sandy. Hey Sandy! (while knocking on her door, a spaceship comes up from underneath the ground at the left side of the tree dome) Wow! (Sandy peeks her head out of a spaceship window)
Sandy: Howdy SpongeBob, how do you like it?
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It’s a rocket ship, duh! I’ll meet you downstairs and show you around.
SpongeBob: Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
Sandy: (pointing to a poster of the moon) I’m going to the moon, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The moon! Can I go?
Sandy: No way, SpongeBob. Especially with your little mishap with my whirlybird. (shown a graveyard of dead animals) Besides, there’s not enough room for you.
SpongeBob: But I don’t take up that much space! (squishes himself into a little square) See? (downsizes himself to fit into a little drawer) I can fit in here. (closes the drawer) Mmm, cozy.
Sandy: I need that drawer.
SpongeBob: Well, how about... (jumps into a test tube) This? (jumps into another test tube) Or this? (jumps into another test tube) Or this?
Sandy: SpongeBob, this isn’t for fun. (shows her clipboard with math equations on it) See this? This is science. I don’t have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. (SpongeBob is behind a set of bars)
SpongeBob: Fine. (deep voice) Put me in the brig, I don’t mind!
Sandy: That’s the air vent, SpongeBob. (pushes a button to turn the air vent on that blows SpongeBob out of it) I need that to.
SpongeBob: Oh please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
Sandy: All right. Y’all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
SpongeBob: (running around the ship) Yeah! Goin’ to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride!
Sandy: (grabs SpongeBob) But this time, just don’t touch anything, ok? (Sandy's pumping a gun)
SpongeBob: Wow, look at that pop-gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
Sandy: Aww, hush, silly. (shoots her gun and 3 gray nets cover a couple items) This is for harvesting moon rocks.
SpongeBob: Well, when you’re done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
Sandy: Aliens? Are you nuts? I’ve been to the moon, there are no aliens.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve. There’s evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99 cent stores? (walks around and forms a circle around him and Sandy with his shoes) And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night? (sees a circle) Ahh, there’s one now!
Sandy: SpongeBob, you don’t know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut-eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave those crazy alien-notions behind.
SpongeBob: (trying to sleep. Checks the clock every few seconds) Oh, hurry up! (grabs two clothespins and puts them on his eyelids) These oughta do the trick.
Patrick: Hiya SpongeBob! (clothespins shoot off his eyes)
SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick? Can’t you see I’m sleeping here?
Patrick: Well, I know you’re going on that moon trip tomorrow so I brought you something.
SpongeBob: A present?
Patrick: No. Uhh, SpongeBob, is Sandy’s rocket alien-proof?
SpongeBob: There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
Patrick: (shows a spray can) Well, I guess you won’t need this alien repellant for your trip!
SpongeBob: Alien repellant? Let me see that. (looks at the can) New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars'. Well, I guess you’re right, Patrick. We’d better go spray those windows! (SpongeBob & Patrick walk up to the rocket)
Patrick: Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: It’s pretty impressive alright.
Patrick: Come on! (both head for the rocket)
SpongeBob: We’re just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
Patrick: Wow. How do you think we get inside? (pulls a level that says 'open')
SpongeBob: We don’t, we’re just spraying the... (door opens on SpongeBob) ...windows.
Patrick: I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on! (both walk inside) Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Just don’t touch anything. (Patrick starts playing with everything)
Patrick: Look, I’m winning!
SpongeBob: Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can’t hang around in here. This is Sandy’s big rocket, not a fun... (SpongeBob turns around and looks at himself as thin in the mirror)...house?
Patrick: Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what was that game anyway?
Patrick: I don’t know! (notices a lever above his head) Let’s see what this does!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don’t think we should... (Patrick pulls a lever and the two launch off the seat out of the rocket)
Patrick: I like rockets. (both fall back into the rocket)
Patrick: More! More!
SpongeBob: No more! (Patrick presses a button and both shake a lot then stop) Ok, one more. (shake again) OK, that’s enough. Let’s go.
Patrick: Oh, wait, I think this one starts it. (SpongeBob stops Patrick from pushing a button)
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? I’m the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. (presses the engine button and the ship starts up and is blasting off)
Patrick: You started the rocket!
Sandy: (notices the smoke) Oh, SpongeBob... (SpongeBob & Patrick hold onto each other while the ship is taking off)
Patrick: Hold on, buddy! (while screaming, SpongeBob & Patrick are falling down to the bottom of the ship. The ship enters space and both of them start to float) Hey, we stopped falling!
SpongeBob: Look! (points at the dark galaxy) We’re in space now! Whee! (both float around in the ship)
Patrick: Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something! (SpongeBob laughs as the ship is going around the moon) Hey SpongeBob, watch this! (squirts toothpaste into some peanut butter)
SpongeBob: Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! (SpongeBob lifts a heavy weight) Patrick, I can do this! ( the ship is landing back into the sea and the heavy weight hurls into the ground and flattens SpongeBob’s hand)
Patrick: Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
SpongeBob: We must be landing.
Patrick: All right! (Sandy uses her jetpack to fly up to the moon)
Sandy: Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. (the ship is now in Bikini Bottom. While Sandy searches for SpongeBob & Patrick on the moon, these two get out of the ship)
Patrick: Wow, it sure looks a lot like home. (Patrick sees Gary asleep) Hey look, it’s Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
SpongeBob: Wait, don’t go near it, Patrick! Can’t you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They’re trying to confuse us, Patrick.
Patrick: So you mean to say they’ve taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
SpongeBob: Ok, but I’m not gonna to fall for it! (SpongeBob captures Gary with a gray net-like substance) Yeah!
Patrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won’t Sandy be proud.
SpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She’s gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won’t she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she’ll love me! (grabs Gary) Come on Patrick, the more the merrier! (tosses Gary into the ship. Ship's number increases from 00 to 01)
Patrick: Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
SpongeBob: Shh, quiet Patrick, don’t let them know we’re onto them! Uhh yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee Patrick, let’s drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he’s up to. (whispering to Patrick) Make sure your gun is pumped. (go in and see Squidward sleeping) Look at it Patrick, it’s disgusting. (Squidward moves his arms and legs around then puts them back down) It’s even uglier up close. Let’s begin the analysis. (SpongeBob takes the covers off)
Patrick: Wait, what’s that? (SpongeBob takes a red bag out) I think I’m gonna be sick.
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
Patrick: Stinky.
SpongeBob: No, it’s an egg sack! Let’s look at the embryo. (Patrick puts flashlight under egg sack and SpongeBob’s hands are under it)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Twins. (Squidward rolls over in his sleep and his right tentacle sticks on Patrick's helmet)
Patrick: Pardon my French but get this thing off me! (SpongeBob & Patrick try to get his tentacles off but they wake him up instead)
Squidward: Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Patrick: It’s awake!
SpongeBob: Hurry, let’s capture the little phony! (Squidward screams)
Squidward: Get away from me! (runs away while SpongeBob & Patrick try to capture him. Outside, Mr. Krabs walks up with his pet worm and notices Squidward's house shaking. SpongeBob & Patrick come out with Squidward captured)
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, lads! Up a bit later to be playing pirate, aren't ye? (laughs. SpongeBob & Patrick points their guns are his head) Wait! Don’t shoot. Ok, shoot but don’t take me money!
SpongeBob: We don’t want your money, moon man! (both capture Mr. Krabs and toss him and Squidward into the ship) Look at them squirming around in there.
Patrick:Eww, gross.
SpongeBob: Well, there’s plenty more where those came from. (at Boating School)
Mrs. Puff: (grading some of her students paper) SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late? (captured) Whatever this is... (inflates herself and has a deep voice) ...it’s going on your permanent record! (Flats, a woman, and Larry are captured along with all of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob & Patrick are run out of room in the ship for everyone)
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob, I think we may have to make another trip.
SpongeBob: There’s no time for that, just push harder. (Sandy is on her jetpack floating down)
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are y’all doing? I can’t turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You all turned my little science experiment into a disaster. Y’all should be ashamed of your- (SpongeBob & Patrick capture her)
SpongeBob: Nice try, Sandy.
Patrick: Or should I say Miss Alien Pants.
Sandy: Aliens? Is this what this is all about? (SpongeBob & Patrick throw her into the ship) This isn’t the moon, we’re still in Bikini Bot... (door is shut)
SpongeBob: It just goes to show you: you can’t trust anybody. (both stare at each other and pump their guns) So, you were an alien all the time and you didn’t even tell me!
Patrick: I didn’t even know.
SpongeBob: Yeah, well I got you now.
Patrick: Oh, well it’s not you who’s got me, it's... (Patrick catches himself with the gray netting) ...me who’s got me!
SpongeBob: Boy, I’d like to see the look on Sandy’s face! (ship runs out of gas and stops on the moon) Sandy, I’m back! (peeks out the window) Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. (sees the Earth) Uh-oh...
Everyone: SpongeBob, we aliens would like a word with you!
Mr. Krabs: (dancing and singing at Pearl's birthday party) Yar har, Pearl’s my daughter, and I’ll spit in your eye! Yo ho, Pearl’s a whale and it’s her birthday, yar yar yar! Ta-da!
Pearl: Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. It’s from me. (places the present in front of Pearl)
Pearl: Oh you shouldn’t have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn’t be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are wearing, would it? Everyone wants them.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...well, they might be.
Pearl: Whee! (begins to unwrap present) Oh, you shouldn’t have, yay, you shouldn’t have. (sees present) I mean, Dad, (holds up big boots) you really shouldn’t have! (Pearl’s friends laugh)
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
Pearl: Dad, you ruined me! (cries)
Mr. Krabs: But I got them for a bargain! (house shakes from Pearl's screaming and crying) Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I’m stuck with them!
SpongeBob: (peeks into Mr. Krabs office) Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBoy Me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddy! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots. (SpongeBob sits down but the boots are in his way so he can't see Mr. Krabs) So you want to get paid?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sir, I can’t see you. The boots (leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other) are in (leans over to one side and Mr Krabs leans towards the other) the way. (Mr. Krabs pushes the boots aside)
Mr. Krabs: In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
Mr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
SpongeBob: Who’s that?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name’s not important, but he was famous all right, don’t you worry.
SpongeBob: I’m ready! I’m ready! I want those boots!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry son, these boots are far too valuable. (puts boots away)
SpongeBob: I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: Paycheck! You got a deal-
SpongeBob: And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
Mr. Krabs: You’re got a deal.
SpongeBob: And I’ll throw in a year’s supply of French fry orders!
Mr. Krabs: You got a...
SpongeBob: And... (Mr. Krabs stops SpongeBob from saying anything else) Hold on there, lad! You’re gonna give me a heart attack. (shakes SpongeBob’s hand) You got yourself a deal. (Squidward is drying off a glass when he looks through the glass and sees SpongeBob wearing boots)
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I’m an official fry cook! (Squidward moans as SpongeBob jumps around the Krusty Krab with the boots and makes squeaky noises)
Squidward: That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music. (at Mr. Krabs house, he is sleeping and dreaming of money jumping into the register when all of a sudden, the pair of squeaky boots jumps in the register. He wakes up) Wha? Who's there? (rests head on pillow) Back to countin' me money. (goes back to sleep and counts coins bouncing into the register until the boots appear again then he wakes up) What the barnacle is that? (window is squeaking open and shut. Mr. Krabs closes the window then goes back into bed but notices the window still open. Goes back to close it but steps into a hole and falls out the window. Comes back into his bedroom and shuts the window over and over until the window finally stays closed. Walks back to his bed but steps into another hole and slips into his bed and twists around in his hammock and is tied up while the window makes squeaky noises all night. It's morning and Mr. Krabs has his two legs bandaged up as he walks to the Krusty Krab) Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I’ll have some peace and quiet at work. (as he walks up to the door, Squidward slams the doors open into Mr. Krabs face)
Squidward: That’s it, Mr. Krabs; I’m taking my vacation now.
Mr. Krabs: What’s wrong, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: I can’t take the world’s greatest fry cook anymore! I’ll see you in a week.
Mr. Krabs: That fry cook’s making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
SpongeBob: Hey Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob. (every time SpongeBob’s boots squeaked Mr. Krabs stuttered) I see you’re still wearing them boots.
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world’s greatest fry cook do this? (runs in place fast with plates of patties in each hand)
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don’t...uhh...I don’t...uhh...
SpongeBob: Or could he do this? (leans over to one table and sets the plate on the table) Or this? (leans to another table and puts plate of patties on it) And watch this, Mr. Krabs! (behind the register on top of the boat talking with the squeaky boots)
Squeaky Boots: May I take you order?
Customer: Yeah, I’ll have the Krusty Special.
Squeaky Boots: Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it’s ready.
SpongeBob: Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I, uhh...
SpongeBob: And watch this Mr. Krabs. (running around the Krusty Krab)
Mr. Krabs: (screams) I gotta go to my office! (puts seat cushions on his ears) I can still hear it! (puts the chairs on his ears) It’s still coming through! The infernal squeak! (banging head on his desk) Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin...
SpongeBob: Gary, these boots have changed my life. I’m never taking them off.
Gary: (puts earplugs in) Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. (as he is sleeping with his boots on, Mr Krabs peeks over his diving board and climbs down. Then takes his boots off and runs to the Krusty Krab. Now morning)
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quiet money. Silence and money. (SpongeBob bursts through the doors)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What is it, my boy?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I’m sorry! Sorry. Sorry. I’m sorry.
Mr. Krabs: It’s ok, son.
SpongeBob: No, it’s not ok! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it’s my fault, I let you down! Oh, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Mr. Krabs: Hold it, boy! It’s not the end of the world.
SpongeBob: Yes it is.
Mr. Krabs: Look, don’t cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts! (SpongeBob puts them on then takes them off)
SpongeBob: They’re not the same! You were right, I wasn’t ready for those blessed boots. (hits the wall then goes into the kitchen)
Mr. Krabs: Poor lad. (looks through the window where SpongeBob put his head onto the hot grill)
Tom: Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs: I didn’t do it! Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
Tom: Yeah, I’m ready to order. (Krabs takes out a notepad)
Mr. Krabs: What’ll ya have?
Tom: I’ll take a (squeak squeak)
Mr. Krabs: What did you say?
Tom: I said, I’ll take a (squeak)
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: I heard his order, Mr Krabs. He says he wants (squeak squeak)
Mr. Krabs: What?
Tom: And a (squeak squeak squeak squeak)
Mr. Krabs: Huh? (everything is squeaking as Mr Krabs goes crazy. Looks at the menu and sees "squeak" as an item for everything) Huh? I didn't write that. (keeps thinking and hearing the squeaks) Stop it! Stop it! Oh, oh, don't you hear it? Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They’re here, under the floorboard! Oh, please, make it stop! It’s the squeaking of the hideous boots! I’m sorry, but I can’t take the infernal squeaking no more! (lifts up the Krusty Krab and grabs the boots. Walks into the kitchen and puts the boots into some liquid which shrinks them and he eats them. Comes out and burps) The deed is done.
SpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Because lad, you didn’t need ‘em. It’s not the boots, it’s the boot-ee. I mean, the person in the boots. You’re a great fry cook.
SpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I do, son. Here’s the paycheck I owe you. Plus a bonus! (takes the bonus back) Well, there’s your paycheck anyway. (walks away) I need a vacation.
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs! (Mr. Krabs and Pearl taking a drive out to somewhere)
Mr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need. Just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Pearl: (lifts feet to reveal her new shoes) Don’t forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Darling, I won’t. (as he laughs, he hiccups and the squeaky noise comes out) Oh-no. (continues to hiccup and squeak)
(SpongeBob is grilling patties until one of them turns into a jellyfish and floats out the window. The rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and buzz out the window. SpongeBob flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. Buzzes around jellyfish fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice)
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob! (the grill is on fire) Wake up, boy! You’re burning me money! (SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and screams. Then runs behind Mr. Krabs)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: Here, use this! (Hands SpongeBob a fire extinguisher. SpongeBob throws the F.E. at the grill and sets the fire larger than before. SpongeBob tries to blow on the fire to put it out until a fireman comes into the kitchen with a hose and sprays SpongeBob with the water. SpongeBob enlarges and falls backwards, which puts out the fire)
Mr. Krabs & Fireman: Hooray! (SpongeBob shrinks and burns into a black sponge while Mr. Krabs scrapes him off the grill and onto a spatula)
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come into me office. (in Mr. Krabs office) What’s wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: Well, I...
Mr. Krabs: This is the fourth time this week I’ve had to scrape you off of something.
SpongeBob: Well, I’ve been thinking.
Mr. Krabs: We need to get you thinking about work. (stretches his eyes out)
SpongeBob: No offense, Mr.. Krabs, but I’ve been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. (Mr. Krabs laughs)
Mr. Krabs: Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn’t last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. (shows kitchen) This is your wide-open range. (shows grill) These are your amber waves. (shows greasy fryers) And this... (picks up a spatula from the sink) ...ohh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That’s better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob? (SpongeBob is gone) SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: (walks out the krusty krab) I can too last more than one day. I’ll show him. Aww, barnacles! (throws his hat on the ground)
Mr. Krabs: (opens doors) SpongeBob, wait! (sees SpongeBob's hat on the ground and screams) Oh, he’ll be back, alright. He’ll be back. (SpongeBob is now giving his stuff away to his friends)
SpongeBob: And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. (gives it to him)
Squidward: And I thought this friendship would never pay off. (walks away)
Patrick: (teary-eyed) Are...are...are...are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
SpongeBob: It’s all yours. (Patrick holds up a bunch of phonebooks)
Patrick: A-a-and these old phone books?
SpongeBob: All yours, old friend. (walks off) Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. (opens up a rectangluar box that has the words "OL' RELIABLE" on the front. A glowing jellyfish net is inside. SpongeBob throws the phonebooks away and picks up ol' reliable)
Patrick: Ol’ Reliable?! (cries as Sandy walks up)
Sandy: Howdy, y’all. Hey SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?
SpongeBob: No Sandy, I’m giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.
Sandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They’re cold and mean and none too bright. (Sponge pats Sandy's helmett)
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That’s exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I’m going to prove I don’t need all this stuff to be happy. (walks away) Maybe someday you’ll wise up and join me. Good-bye. (walks behind a bush and takes his pants off) I won’t be needing these. (drops pants and runs away) Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Squidward: He took off his pants.
Sandy: I’ll give him a week. (walks away)
Squidward: I’ll give him eleven minutes. (walks away)
Patrick: Patrick sad! (at Jellyfish Fields)
SpongeBob: (touches 'Jellyfish Fields' sign) I’m home. I’m home! I’m home! I’m home, I’m home, I’m home, I’m home, I’m home, I’m home, I’m home, I’m home, I'm home! (jellyfish knock SpongeBob down as they fly by) Brothers and sisters, wait for me! (jellyfish fly into a hive) Buzz-buzz. Buzz-buzz. Ok, I’m here! (jellyfish fly out of hive) Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... (sticks his finger in his mouth and then in his head) ...that way. (points to where the jellyfish went) Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. (running after jellyfish all over the fields. Jellyfish devour a bunch of kelp. SpongeBob decides to try it but is disgusted and spits it out) This is the life. (jellyfish are floating in the middle of the fields as SpongeBob walks into the middle of the group) Hey everybody, buzz-buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what’s the buzz? (wants to shake a jellyfish's hand) Hello, I’m Jellybob, and you are? (jellyfish stings him and his arm goes numb) Uhh...nice to meet you. (hand gets huge. SpongeBob smells some aroma and goes to check and see that Patrick and Sandy are having a picnic with krabby patties)
Sandy: Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty! (whispers into Patricks ear) There he is, Patrick. Say your line!
Patrick: (reading off paper)Why thank you, Sandy, I would love one. Take patty. Too bad SpongeBob isn’t here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he’d come home. Take bite. (tries to but throws the patty away and turns to SpongeBob) I can’t do it! SpongeBob! Come back!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I’m not coming home.
Patrick: I miss you. Sandy misses you. Even Squidward misses you! (Squidward is throwing himself a party at home)
SpongeBob: I’m happy here. This is my home now. (Sandy drags Patrick away)
Patrick: No!! SpongeBob!! (later, SpongeBob comes in wiggling his arms and legs like the jellyfish)
SpongeBob: Hey everybody! I’m back! I think I’m getting the hang of this. (jellyfish float away as the net is swung at SpongeBob, which knocks him down. Patrick is ready to capture SpongeBob with Ol' Reliable) Patrick! What are you doing?
Patrick: If I can’t have you as a friend, I’m going to make you a trophy! I even picked out this nice jar for you! (shows a jar with a label on the front that says 'SPONGEBOB - FRIEND')
SpongeBob: Patrick! Go home! I’m a jellyfish now! (Patrick swings the net at SpongeBob but SpongeBob runs away. Patrick goes after him. SpongeBob hides behind a snail's shell but the snail slithers off. SpongeBob goes to hide behind a rock)
Patrick: I can see you there! (SpongeBob hides behind a bush) I still see you! (SpongeBob hides behind another rock) You’re going to look good on my mantel! (SpongeBob runs under neath an 'n' shaped rock and peeks around. Patrick is underneath the rock on the top) Friends forever, SpongeBob! I got you now, SpongeBob! (falls on the ground and misses SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Patrick! No! (Patrick runs after SpongeBob again as SpongeBob jumps into the jellyfish hive. Patrick tries to get the hive down with the net but is unsuccessful multiple times)
Patrick: Ok! So this is the way it’s going to be. I hope you’re happy. (breaks net in half)
SpongeBob: Well, that’s over. Back to jellyfish matters. (a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it) Mmm...jelly. (eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive) Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. (jellyfish buzz into the hive) Greetings, comrades! (jellyfish sting SpongeBob a lot and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive and runs as the jellyfish keep stinging him. Later, SpongeBob is in a cave) Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. (rips off a bushel of grass) Buzz. (pushes rock over as he uses it for his pillow) Buzz. (pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The 'blanket' scrunches up but SpongeBob pushes it back down. Blanket scrunches up again and SpongeBob gets cold.) Hey! Eww, I’m itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! (takes off the blanket and reveals 9 poison sea urchins) Poison sea urchins! (screams and scratches the urchins off of him and runs out of the cave) Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. (crawls on the ground to stop the itching. Later, SpongeBob is walking towards his house) Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. (buzzes 14 more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door and sees a plate full of krabby patties on a table) Krabby Patties. (walks past Sandy's treedome) Sandy. (still buzzing, walks up to his pineapple) What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. (opens door and turns the light on. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are there to welcome him home)
All: Welcome home, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. (hands him a krabby patty)
SpongeBob: Don’t mind if I do. (eats it as Mr. Krabs places his krusty krew hat on his head)
Mr. Krabs: And I’ll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: (salutes) Aye, aye, captain!
Squidward: SpongeBob, do us all a favor. (hands SpongeBob his pants)
SpongeBob: Don’t mind if I do. (puts on his pants) Ta-da! (hugs Squidward) Aww...
Squidward: Ok, that’s enough. (everyone else hugs SpongeBob and Squidward)
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Can we please stop this? (everyone stops hugging)
Patrick: Patrick itchy! (everyone but SpongeBob starts to scratch themselves and crawl on the floor)
SpongeBob: It is great to be home!
(Squidward is sleeping and hearing noises. He awakens to reveal SpongeBob and Patrick under his blanket with a sign that reads "happy birthday")
SpongeBob & Patrick: Surprise! Happy birthday, Squidward! (all 3 standing in front of a cake) Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday cake! (standing in front of a picture of a seahorse and Squidward has the tail) Happy happy birthday! Pin the tail on the seahorse! (surrounded by presents) Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday Squidward! (SpongeBob & Patrick run out of Squidward's house)
Squidward: It’s not my birthday! (shuts door and takes off party hat) That’s it, I’m moving out of this neighborhood!
Realtor Lady: (looking at a picture of Squidward's house) Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles! (woman from Bikini Realty on phone) I can sell your home in a heartbeat.
Squidward: Oh that’s great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
Realtor Lady: No problem! As long as it’s not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.
Squidward: Oh sure, there’s none of that... Did you say neighbors?
Realtor Lady: Of course! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.
Squidward: Neighbors. Uhh...
Realtor Lady: Anyway, I’ll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then! (both hang up)
Squidward: SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite...opposite... (Later, SpongeBob is sleeping but is awaken from Squidward's instrument playing outside)
SpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum? (Squidward stops playing)
Squidward: Drum? What drum? (puts the drum on the ground and punches a hole in it) This is just my wig case! (puts on the wig and frolics around) Come on SpongeBob, tackle me!
SpongeBob: Squidward! You need bed rest! (pushes Squidward to his house as Squidward is blowing bubbles) I’ll keep you safe until you’re well again.
Squidward: Oh, I get it. You don’t know what day it is, do you?
SpongeBob: Uhh, Wednesday?
Squidward: Why, it’s Opposite Day! (SpongeBob is confused) You mean you’ve never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I’m stuffy, boring, but today I’m silly and spontaneous!
SpongeBob: Does everybody know about Opposite Day?
Squidward: Oh sure! It’s a game! Get it?
SpongeBob: Oh, a game.
Squidward: Yeah! Normally, you’re really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?
SpongeBob: Quiet and out of the way! Yay!
Squidward: Yeah! Why don’t you get a jump on it.
SpongeBob: I love...I mean, I hate Opposite Day. (giggles as he runs back into his pineapple) I’m not ready!
Squidward: So long, chum! (takes off wig) And goodbye, Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: (running to Gary) Gary! It’s Opposite Day and I... (stops running) ...walk, don’t run. And I’m gonna...opposite...opposite...I’m just going to crawl into bed and do nothing all day. (crawls into bed) Too bad it only comes once a year, huh Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary, where's your holiday spirit?!
Gary: (barks)
SpongeBob: (doorbell rings) Company! I hate company. Who’s there?
Patrick: It’s Patrick!
SpongeBob: Patrick...go away! I never want to see you again! (giggles but Patrick cries)
Patrick: SpongeBob doesn’t like me anymore!
SpongeBob: (opens door) That’s right! You’re my worse enemy! (Patrick cries more) Patrick, you’re not really not my friend. It’s just Opposite Day!
Patrick: Opposite Day? Hey, I’ve heard of that!
SpongeBob: You have?
Patrick: No, what is it?!
SpongeBob: Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.
Patrick: Oh! Let me try! Let me try! (Patrick holds his breath and turns purple)
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick, breathe! Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way! (SpongeBob & Patrick dance across the screen as SpongeBob is pink and Patrick is yellow. Gary eats properly from a table. SpongeBob eats from Gary's bowl) Meow.
Patrick: (sitting on newspapers) Meow. (SpongeBob & Patrick blows a bubble but they blow themselves into bubbles, instead. Both talk and laugh backwards) Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?
Patrick: Nope. (both laugh)
Squidward: Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob! (packing his belongings into boxes) I’m almost sorry I’m leaving! (laughs) Opposite Day. (hears noises from outside) SpongeBob, what are you... (screams as he sees SpongeBob & Patrick destroying his pineapple) Ahh!
SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward! I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn’t Opposite Day.... (giggles) ...terrible?! (laughs)
Squidward: I’ll tell you what’s terrible! Living next to you! You are the worst neighbor in history!
SpongeBob: Wow! That’s the nicest thing Squidward’s ever said to me! (Squid smacks his forehead)
Squidward: (panicked) If the real estate agent sees that mess, I’ll never sell this house! (Pat and Sponge marvel at their mess)
Patrick: Isn’t it beautiful?
SpongeBob: On Opposite Day it is. (Squidward drives up with a bulldozer)
Squidward: Out of the way, SpongeBob! (Squidward begins to rebuild the pineapple)
SpongeBob: I don’t get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, (Sponge wraps his arms around himself repeatedly) but that really means he’s messing it up. (Patrick is drooling) But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, (Gary meows) Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he’s SpongeBob! (SpongeBob wrapped his arms around himself) A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being... (stretches his nose out and puts his belt around the middle of his head) (talks like Squidward) Squidward!
Patrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite too! (SpongeBob thinks then snaps his fingers. He takes a piece of coral and puts it below Patrick's eyes where his nose would be) Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo! (dances) I’m Squidward, I’m Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Wait! It’s not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite... (talking like Squidward) ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long but I never get any better. (normal voice again) Now you try.
Patrick: Ok. (takes a deep breath and continues dancing) I’m Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward. (SpongeBob dances along with Patrick)
SpongeBob & Patrick: I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: (opens door for Patrick) After you, Mr. Squidward.
Patrick: Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward. (walks in)
SpongeBob: You’re quite welcome, Mr. Squidward. (walks in and shuts door)
Squidward: (still rebuilding pineapple) Oh, Opposite Day. Next time it’s going to be "Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!" (as he is building, the realtor lady drives up)
Realtor Lady: Oh my, the house is even more beautiful in person! (knocks on the door. SpongeBob opens it) Hello Mr... (looks down) ...Mr. Tentacles?
SpongeBob: (talking like Squidward) Yes, please come in.
Realtor Lady: It’s funny, I pictured you being much taller.
SpongeBob: Yeah, everyone says that.
Realtor Lady: Now if you want the sale to go through, you’ve got to tell me all the positive things about your house.
SpongeBob: Positive things! Opposite Day...I’d love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there’s a terrible draft.
Realtor Lady: Uhh...well, you didn’t mention that on the phone.
SpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There’s a wild man eating clam in the backyard. Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?
Realtor Lady: Well, umm, I’m not sure if I’m interested...
SpongeBob: Nonsense! I won’t take no for an answer. (laughs then stops) Please follow me. (both walk into Squidward's art room) And here’s the worst room in the house: my gallery.
Realtor Lady: Oh my, this painting is very nice. (Patrick bursts through the painting)
Patrick: Thank you! (woman screams and jumps up to the ceiling)
Realtor Lady: Who’s that?
SpongeBob: I’d like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
Realtor Lady: You’re both Squidward?
SpongeBob: I’m Squidward, he’s Squidward.
SpongeBob & Patrick: We’re both Squidward.
Squidward: Well, that’s done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet. (sees the realtor's boat and screams) Ahh, no! (SpongeBob is playing clarinet for the lady)
Realtor Lady: Okay, I really don’t want to hear another one.
SpongeBob: Okay. (plays more)
Realtor Lady: I really don’t want to hear more, thank you.
SpongeBob: I hear you loud and clear. (plays more)
Squidward: (opens door) Stop! Get away from her! Oh, I am so sorry, ma’am, I hope these two (barnacle heads) haven’t harmed you in any way.
Realtor Lady: Who are you?
Squidward: Why, I’m Squidward!
Realtor Lady: What kind of fool do you take me for? He’s Squidward, he’s Squidward, you’re Squidward, I’m Squidward! Are there any other Squidward’s I should know about?!
Gary: (in Squidward's voice with a pickle as a nose) Meow.
Realtor Lady: I’m out of here.
Squidward: Ma’am, please! What about my house?!
Realtor Lady: I wouldn’t sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on Earth! (walks off)
Squidward: Wait!
SpongeBob: Don’t...
Patrick: ...go! (Squidward screams and hangs onto the realtor lady's legs)
Squidward: No, no, no! Please sell my house!
Realtor Lady: Never! (gets in boat drives off)
Squidward: Don’t leave me here! (cries as SpongeBob & Patrick walk up)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you!
Squidward: Let me show you guys how much I hate you! (Squidward drives up with a bulldozer chasing SpongeBob & Patrick away)
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you ever feel Squidward likes us too much?
Squidward: (angry) Happy Opposite Day! (chases them down the street and laughs angrily)
(no customers at the Krusty Krab as Mr Krabs is holding a FREE sign for the salad bar, Squidward is reading a ballet magazine, and SpongeBob is wiping dust off tables)

Mr Krabs: I just don’t get it. If a free salad bar doesn’t bring in customers, what will?! (Squidward is dancing) Squidward!

Squidward: Yes, sir?

Mr Krabs: There’s gonna be some changes around here. (customer walks in. Mr Krabs gasps) A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab! (runs up to the customer with a chair and seats him. Brings him back to the table) SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don’t screw this one up.

SpongeBob: Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, (you) are the captain, and I, a mere cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?

Customer: All I wanted was change for the pay phone. (shows the dollar)

SpongeBob: Aye aye sir! (runs off quickly and comes back with change) Monsieur’s changé.

Customer: Thanks. (laughs nervously and leaves a penny on the table) Here you go. (runs off as Mr Krabs smells the penny and jumps on it. Later, we are in Mr Krabs office with Squidward and SpongeBob)

Mr Krabs: Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month. (pulls down a chart with zig-zag linges going down and his eyes sticking out on each side) We’ve got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers. (pulls the chart up) Do you lubbers have any ideas?

SpongeBob: I’ve got one! (takes out a tray with a soda and a pair of socks on it) A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... (talks with mouth full of clams) ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?
Mr Krabs: Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment. (Squidward gasps)
Squidward: That’s it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host me! (runs up to Mr Krabs with stars in his eyes) This is the moment I’ve...I mean, we’ve been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.

Mr Krabs: The money? (Squidward lying on the table)
Squidward: And I can see it now...your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.

Mr Krabs: (Mr Krabs looks at his picture of him and Pearl) Little Pearly...a star?
SpongeBob: Hoppin’ clams! A talent show! I’m talented! I’d better call my folks! (runs off as Squidward and Mr Krabs shake hands)

Mr Krabs: Squidward, you’ve got a deal. Make my little girl a star! (later, the restaurant is being redecorated for the show)

SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?

Squidward: Going on what?

SpongeBob: The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!

Squidward: What talent could you possibly possess? (SpongeBob blows a big bubble which turns into a hippo. Then blows two small bubbles for the hat and cane. Both dance)

SpongeBob: Ta-da! (Squidward yawns)

Squidward: No one, not even your parents, would want to see that. (hippo bubble pops) What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.

SpongeBob: Ok, I get it. Don’t worry, Squidward, I’m going to come up with the most cultured act ever!

Squidward: I can hardly wait. (SpongeBob runs off) Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes. (laughs) Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. (now the night of the talent show where people are outside conducting interviews and people inside are talking and getting set-up)

SpongeBob: (peeks out from behind the curtain) Wow! A full house! (gasps) There’s Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! (Mr Krabs shakes Mr Squarepants hand)

Mr Krabs: Hello, I’m Mr Krabs, and I like money.

SpongeBob: I gotta get ready! (Squidward gets everyones attention)

Squidward: Alright people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop. (performers gather around) Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it’s not. It’s mine.

SpongeBob: Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? (runs off and runs back with a tub full of water and the words 'Mister Absorbency' written on the front) The Amazing Mister Absorbency! (puts his finger in the water and absorbs it. Absorbs the water into his legs) Ta-da! (absorbs water into his head) Ta-da!

Squidward: No one is going to watch you engorge yourself. (grabs Squidward's legs)

SpongeBob: Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I’ll do anything! Anything! Anything!

Squidward: So you really want to be in the show?

SpongeBob: Oh, yes!

Squidward: Ok, you get to mop up afterwards. (hands SpongeBob a mop) Now will you stop bugging me? (walks off)

SpongeBob: So, this is what it feels like...the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! (show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo)

Squidward: Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. (Patrick laughs) Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. (Patrick laughs) Put your fins together for... (Patrick laughs) Put your... (Patrick laughs) Put... (Patrick laughs) Pearl. (crowd claps as curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheereleader uniform)

Mr Krabs: Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.

Pearl: Give me a K-R-U! (jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her) Give me a S-T-Y! (jumps up and down again) Krusty Krab! (jumps up and down) Krusty Krab! (jumps up and down) Krusty Krab! (jumps up and down)

Mr Krabs: That’s what I call talent! (Krusty Krab floor is destroyed)

Pearl: Thank you! Thank you, thank you! (Squidward closes curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water)

SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, listen, what do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no, side to side. (Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage)

Squidward: And now, poetry. (walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain) By Gary. (curtain opens. Gary is on a stool)


Gary: Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
Sandy: He had such a way with words.

Squidward: (checks his watch) Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn’t hurry it up, we’re not going to have time for the best act...me! (SpongeBob walks up)

SpongeBob: Squidward, should I use Mr Cleanser or Dr Clean?

Squidward: Yes. (audience applauds as curtain opens reveleaing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!!!')

Plankton: I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... (turns his wand into flowers) …will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. (throw the flowers aside) First, I’ll need a volunteer from the audience. (jumps onto a table and grabs the krabby patty from the customer. Runs toward the door but Mr Krabs stops Plankton)

Mr Krabs: Nice try. Your act’s over, bub. (grabs the patty)

Plankton: You may win this time. She-hah-kazeek! (he claps his hands and ignites into a puff of smoke. The smoke clears and he is completely charred) Well, this stinks. (he walks off and it booed. Krabs runs up to Squid backstage, leaving a trail of flames)

Mr Krabs: Squidward! This show is a disaster! You’re ruining me!
Squidward: Now, now, don’t you worry, Mr Krabs. I’ve saved the best for last, you’ll see.

Mr Krabs: For your sake, I hope you’re right. (bunch of spot lights gleam around Krusty Krab)

Squidward: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you’ve all been waiting for. We’ve saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! ('Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights. Curtain opens and the background is a canyon. Squidward dances with birds. Then the lights go dark and music is techno as Squidward dances weird. Crowd boos and throws tomatoes at him)

Mr Krabs: I’m losing money on this deal! (puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar)

Fish: It’s worth every penny. (eveyrone runs up to Mr Krabs with dollar bills in hand)

Squidward: You bottom feeders! You don’t even know talent!
Crowd: No talent! No talent! No talent! (curtain closes)

SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, can I go on now?

Squidward: Yeah, show’s over! (crown continues booing as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him)

Crowd: Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that. Alright!

Squidward: They want an encore! (pushes SpongeBob away) Stand aside, SpongeBob! (Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage and SpongeBob comes back out and crowd cheers again. Squidward jumps out again and the crowd grows silent again. Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. Then shows the crowd SpongeBob and they cheer. Puts his own head through the curtain and crowd goes silent. SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer but Squidward's doesn't. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent. Someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Mr & Mrs Squarepants bring Mr Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of money)

Mr Krabs: You did it, Squidward! What a great show!

Mrs SquarePants: Oh, my son’s a star!

Mr SquarePants: Who ever knew he had such talent.

Mr Krabs: I’ll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week’s show! (crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob)
Narrator: Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties. (lights go off as everyone in the Krusty Krab screams and runs for cover) Huh?! What’s this? (doors and windows are now metal)
Mr. Krabs: Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Down there, sir! (a krabby patty is bouncing to the door)
Narrator: (gasps) There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress! (krabby patty shoots a laser hole big enough for it to go through at the door) There can only be one culprit: Plankton!
Plankton: Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! (laughs)
Squidward: He got away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: No! He’s finally stolen my secret recipe!
Narrator: Perhaps not, mousier Krabs, for it’s... (SpongeBob tears himself into another SpongeBob and flies off)SpongeBob SquarePants! (later, SpongeBob peeks out through under the sewer with binoculars in hand. Catches a peek at a krabby patty jumping through the crowd)
SpongeBob: A-ha! (chases it behind some buildings) Hey! (krabby patty flies up with a propeller. SpongeBob takes the twirling club that the cop is using as a propeller and flies after the krabby patty to the top of a building) Ok, that’s far enough! Huh? (patty jumps off building) Tarter sauce! (uses his hat as a balloon-like ball and jumps off the building. Bounces off the ground towards the krabby patty. Bounces past a cowboy and a cowgirl)
Cowboy: Yeehaw! )patty walks into a magic shop and comes back out with funny glasses on) Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It’s about this tall and... (looks up and reads the sign 'MAGIC SHOP') Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, 'If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.' (plankton takes away krabby patty)
Plankton: Argh! I can’t take it!
SpongeBob: Plankton! It’s you!
Plankton: Yes, and after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that...that just wasn’t fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don’t want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don’t know what it’s like to be a loser. (cries)
SpongeBob: Aww, cheer up Plankton. I think you’re a winner.
Plankton: Wh-what did you say?
SpongeBob: I said, you’re a... (a bunch of people run up and point at Plankton)
All: Loser! (Planktons jumps away from group and walks back to his restaurant)
Squidward: How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton? It hurts, doesn’t it? I know!
Policeman: Yeah, and for running you out, we’re going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day. (puts a big donut with a ribbon on it around SpongeBob)
Song: Bikini Bottom "For he's a Jolly Good Rookie"
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, a Policeman, Fred, Tammy, Joe, Millie, Ricardo, and Stella: For he’s a jolly good rookie,
 for he’s a jolly good rookie,
 for he’s a jolly good rookie...


(everyone throws SpongeBob into the air)
SpongeBob: (thinking to himself) I’ll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn’t be such a meanie.
All: (as SpongeBob comes down, they stop singing) Which nobody... (everyone walks away. Later, Plankton hears a knock on his door at his restaurant)
Plankton: A customer? (opens door) Our special today is chum... (sees SpongeBob at the door) ...balaya.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Haven’t you degraded me enough for one day?
SpongeBob: No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Plankton: Wha?
SpongeBob: Play with me.
Plankton: You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
SpongeBob: No, but I like to go... (Plankton closes the door)
Plankton: That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?
Karen: You’re not letting him leave, are you? Can’t you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!
Plankton: Elaborate. (computer shows images of a krabby patty and SpongeBob)
Karen: Befriend the sponge bath, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Take the Krabby Patty? (runs back to the door)
Karen: Get moving genius, don’t let him get away. (Plankton opens the door)
SpongeBob: ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
Plankton: Alright, SpongeBob, I’ll play your little game.
SpongeBob: Great! (SpongeBob grabs Plankton and runs off) Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! (now at Jellyfish Fields) So, I get the big net and you get the little net. (hands Plankton a net bigger than him)
Plankton: What happens after we eat ‘em?
SpongeBob: You don’t eat ‘em, you catch ‘em, like this! (captures a jellyfish) Like that.
Plankton: And?
SpongeBob: And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
Plankton: Stingers? (Plankton imagines ruling Bikini Bottom with a jellyfish that only he controls) All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win!
SpongeBob: It’s not about winning, it’s about fun!
Plankton: What’s that?
SpongeBob: Fun is when you...fun is...it’s like...it’s kinda...sort of like a...
Song: F.U.N. (Song)
What is fun? let me spell it for you


F is for friends who do stuff together. 
 U is for you and me. 
 N is for anywhere and anytime at all. 
 Down here in the deep blue sea. 


F is for fire that burns down the whole town.
 U is for uranium... bombs! 
 N is for no survivors when you- 


Plankton! those things aren't were fun is all about
 Now, do it like this


F is for friends who do stuff together 


Never! That's completely idiotic 


Here, let me help you


F is for friends who do stuff together 
 U is for you and me Try it!
 N is for anywhere and anytime at all
 Down here in the deep blue sea


Wait I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside
 Should we stop?
 No! That's how you suppose to feel!
 Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
 Okay!


F is for frolic through all the flowers. 
 U is for ukulele. 
 N is nose-sticking, sharing gum, and sand-licking here with my best
 buddy.


Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha


(looking through a telescope at SpongeBob & Plankton)
Arr, mutiny!


(at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is changing clothes)
Plankton: And after that we frolicked through the flowers and then we...
Karen: Sounds like fun.
Plankton: Well the really fun part was when we...
Karen: Where’s the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: The what? (shows a krabby patty on Karen's computer screen)
Karen: The Krabby Patty, remember?
Plankton: You can’t rush these things you know.
Karen: You’re forgetting about the mission! (shows a formula)
Plankton: What are you talking about?
Karen: You’re going native, Plankton! Look at yourself! (metal arm picks up Plankton and shows him wearing square pants like SpongeBob's)
Plankton: What?
Mr. Krabs: I haven’t seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
SpongeBob: Who knows? Maybe he’s changed.
Mr. Krabs: Who knows? I think you know! (shows a picture of him and Plankton holding up the letters for FUN)
SpongeBob: He’s changed, I tell you! (Plankton enters)
Plankton: SpongeBuddy! Yoohoo! (SpongeBob runs over to Plankton)
SpongeBob: Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private. (talking to Plankton) You won’t mind if I set this here, will you? (puts a plate with a krabby patty on the table and pushes it toward him)
SpongeBob: What’s this all about, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He’s a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he’s...
SpongeBob: Why can’t you just accept our friendship?
Mr. Krabs: He’s just after me recipe. I’ll prove it to you. (walks up to Plankton) Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Plankton: Oh, yes, but I’m saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...suit yourself. (walks off then comes back to push the plate closer to Plankton. Uses a fan to get the smell to Plankton)
SpongeBob: We’ve had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! (turns the fan off) Come on Plankton, let’s get out of here. (both walk away)
Mr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton’s gone straight. (plate falls down revealing that it was cardboard) Or maybe scallops will fly out of my pants! (takes the boat and paddles to the movies) Hold on there laddie, I’m a-comin’! (at the movies, SpongeBob & Plankton are sitting in the front row. SpongeBob is giving popcorn to Plankton as he is eating some himself. Then Bubblebass comes down and sits in Plankton's seat, squishing him)
SpongeBob: I sure like sequels, Plankton. (sees Bubblebass in his spot) Hey Bubblebass, you’re sitting on my friend. (Bubblebass gets comfortable in his seat) Hey Bubblebass! (throws some popcorns and Bubblebass runs after it)
Plankton: Thanks for that, friend.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, pal.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up! (Mr. Krabs shadow is on the movie screen)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? (in the projector room)
Mr. Krabs: He’s deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he’s got! (the ladies reach in their husbands pockets and takes out a watch, some money and a piggy bank then run off) You too, boy! (SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and takes out a krabby patty)
SpongeBob: (gasps) I can’t believe this!
Plankton: It’s not what you think.
SpongeBob: What is it then? What do you see here?
Plankton: I...I don’t see anything.
SpongeBob: (crying) How can you not see it?
Plankton: Ok, ok, I see it! It’s a Krabby Patty, ok? I couldn’t help it!
SpongeBob: But we sang the F.U.N. song! I think I’m gonna be sick. How long?
Plankton: How long what?
SpongeBob: How long were you planning on doing this? Tell me! What?
Plankton: (crying) Alright, it’s true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship! And now I realize, that’s all I really wanted.
SpongeBob: Really? (Plankton grabs the patty and jumps towards the screen)
Plankton: No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! (Plankton laughs)
Movie: Oh darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart. (Plankton rips through the screen)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he’s gone. He got the patty. He won.
Mr. Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn’t, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete! (laughs. Plankton is squished on the wall. Mr. Krabs takes the krabby patty)
SpongeBob: I’m sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
Plankton: Don’t blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let’s go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Well, maybe on a discount. (Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubblebass's jellybeans. Plankton runs around his hand so he doesn't get caught)
SpongeBob: It's time to grow myself large and wide. (grows himself large and wide as he is saying it. Walks over to his weight, which is a pink bunny and a blue bear and has struggle lifting it but gets it over hit head. Doorbell rings. Opens door)
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
SpongeBob: Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out. (shows off his muscles but is still a weakling)
Sandy: Well, you're smelly.
SpongeBob: All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. (shows all sorts of stuffed animals)
Sandy: Uhh, I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob but you won't see any progress with those.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Sandy: That is, if you want arms like these. (shows off big, masculine muscles) Or these. (shows off other arm muscles) Or these. (shows off all muscles. SpongeBob's arm wiggles in the air)
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
Sandy: Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? That'd be great Sandy. I can see me now. (imagines himself with muscles and very tall playing in the Krusty Krab, Jellyfish Fields & sleeping) Yeah...that would change everything.
Sandy: Be at my place at 5 a.m. And you'll need a water helmet. (puts a fish bowl on his head. Now, at Sandy's tree dome where SpongeBob is trying to do push-ups) Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups. Come on. Come on. You can do it. (SpongeBob is grunting at this point determined to get a push-up. His body cracks and falls down while his arms stay up)
SpongeBob: One. (acorn bell dings)
Sandy: (in boxing ring with gloves on) Alright, put 'em up.
SpongeBob: (struggles getting his gloves up) They're up.
Sandy: Ding ding. (punches SpongeBob out of the ring. Later, Sandy starts up her exercise wheel with SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob pants while the wheel goes faster and makes him trip all over the wheel) Feeling the burn?
SpongeBob: I'm feeling something. (launches out of the wheel and into the tree dome glass)
Sandy: Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm- cruncher.
SpongeBob: Arm-cruncher, great. (sees 2 cement blocks slamming into the cement pedestal) This squirrel's trying to kill me.
Sandy: (walks up to the arm-cruncher with phone in hand) This is it.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. (hangs up) This working out thing isn't working out. (arms bulge in and out) Ow. Ow. Ow.
TV: Hey, you. Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy. "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
SpongeBob: Huh?
TV: With anchor arms! (puts a long pink item on his arm) Fits like a glove. Just add air. (puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it) How big do you want 'em? (pumps air into other arm) Normal? (puts more air into arm) Veiny? And for the ladies... (puts air into arm which makes it grow hair) ...hairy. (SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark) "I was a wimp before anchor arms." Now, I'm a jerk and everybody loves me. So order now, wimp.
SpongeBob: Wow, now that's a good idea.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone. (later, a big shadow of SpongeBob is walking down the road past Squidward, who is licking a popsicle) Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: (Mr. Krabs is sweeping outside the Krusty Krab) Huh?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Mother of pearl. (hides in the Krusty Krab. Now, at Mussel Beach where everyone is lifting weights. SpongeBob comes in and makes one guy drop a big weight on two others feet)
SpongeBob: Hi, guys. (shows off new muscles)
Larry: SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: (walking on his hands) Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait...wait... (flexes those muscles) They're big aren't they?
Larry: Dude, you're ripped.
SpongeBob: (flexes out the words) Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. (flexes more) Yeah. Anyone up for the... (flexes muscles into drinks) ...juice bar?
Scooter: I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
Sandy: Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Scooter: You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there. (points to inside of bar)
Sandy: Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
SpongeBob: I start off with 20 raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Sandy: Pardon me.
SpongeBob: Working out is my life. I remember when I used to look like that guy over there. (points to weak fish)
Fish: Who me? (everyone laughs)
SpongeBob: I remember when I used to look like you, too. (points to Larry and laughs) But, that was a long time ago.
Bartender: Here's your drink, sir.
SpongeBob: Thank you. (tries to lift up drinks but can't so he stretches his mouth out to the straw and drinks) Yeah...
Sandy: SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
SpongeBob: I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. (anchor arm almost slips off) Whoops. Yeah, I have never felt better.
Sandy: Heck, what's your secret?
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: Your secret workout. What is it? (everyone wants to know)
SpongeBob: Hmmm, well...I, uhh...first I take my hand and I do this... (makes armpit noises)
Larry: Are you kidding?
SpongeBob: Do these muscles lie? (flexes muscles into a shape of a sponge. Everyone starts making armpit noises)
Sandy: I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
SpongeBob: Yeah, you're workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
Sandy: Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you mean?
Sandy: The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today. Everybody'll be there.
Bartender: Here's your drink. (sets drink on SpongeBob's anchor-arm hand and sinks down)
Sandy: Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
SpongeBob: Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
Sandy: C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob: Now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... (tries to run away but the drink is holding him back. Tries lifting the drink but is unsuccessful) Sandy, wait!
Sandy: Here it is-- the sign-in list.
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
Sandy: (signs her name on a piece of paper) Ok, Sandy Cheeks. (puts paper into entry box)
SpongeBob: (still struggling) Wait, Sandy-- don't sign just yet. (struggles even harder)
Sandy: Ok...
SpongeBob: Wait!
Sandy: (signs names) SpongeBob SquarePants. (bartender lifts drink off of SpongeBob which sends him flying towards Sandy)
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait... (slams into pole)
Sandy: It's ok, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. (at competition)
Announcer: We're on! Welcome to the Goo Lagoon 8th annual anchor toss competition. (everyone is getting ready but SpongeBob is so nervous)
Sandy: Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. (blows frantically into his anchor arms)
Announcer: Could I get some Ketchup on that? Oh. First up, Don the Whale. (Don throws the anchor and lands. Person comes up to measure distance)
Measurer: 200 yards. (crowd cheers)
Announcer: Let's see an instant-replay. (another anchor comes flying in on top of the measurer) Amazing! Up next, Larry the Lobster. (Larry throws his anchor and it follows the measurer wherever he goes)
Measurer: 210 yards.
Announcer: Here goes, Sandy Cheeks. (Sandy throws it up in the air and kicks it. Measurer runs around until he gets hit)
Measurer: 510 yards.
Announcer: Wow! Fabulous!
Sandy: Beat that, SpongeBob.
Announcer: Up next, SpongeBob SquarePants.
Crowd: (crowd is imitating the armpit exercise while others are holding up SpongeBob signs and chanting) SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: (tries to move the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs) Just kidding. Just kidding. (everyone laughs)
Sandy: That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it. I've got anchor arms. I'm no wimp, I'm a jerk. (blows into anchor arms to makes them "JERK" size. Tries the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose making it huge. Tries the anchor again but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd 'ooh's. Tries the anchor again but the air goes into his left tooth. Tries the anchor again but the air goes everywhere around his body then explodes. When the smoke clears, anchor arms are floating down)
Crowd Attendee: I think he lost. (crowd chants for Sandy) Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! (Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot. Tells SpongeBob to follow her. Later, back at her tree dome)
SpongeBob: 96. 97. 98. 99. 100.
Sandy: I want 100 more.
SpongeBob: It hurts. (changes channel over and over) 1. 2. 3. 4...
Sandy: I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ...9. 10. (arm falls off) Can you get that?
Squidward: (talking to a wax statue of himself) Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eye's...a little lopsided. (takes out the right eye, fixes it then puts it back in place) There. And now that I’ve been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile. (Squidward makes wax statue smile. Then he ears a crash from outside and frowns, as does the statue as well)
SpongeBob: Hike, Patrick, hike! (both run in separate directions but SpongeBob has a big rock. Drops the rock on the ground and it breaks in half) You just lost three points. (climbs a tree branch) One. Two. Five! (flips upside down and blows a bubble into a shape) G-7!
Patrick: G-7? King me! King me! (runs into the coral branch and pops the bubble) I lose!
SpongeBob: But it’s not Tuesday, Patrick.
Patrick: Tarter sauce! (Squidward peeks out)
Squidward: Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
SpongeBob & Patrick: We don’t know.
Squidward: Hey Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Patrick: Uh, yeah, Squidward, it’s... (checks his watch but all the bubble soap leaks out when he turns his wrist around)
Squidward: Time to find some other game to play! (laughs. Turns on the record player while taking a bubble bath)
SpongeBob: Now what?
Patrick: (notices a shell on the ground) We could toss that shell back and forth.
SpongeBob: (picks up shell) Ok, ready! (throws shell into Patrick's belly. Patrick shoots it into the air)
Patrick: Go! (SpongeBob goes after it)
SpongeBob: I got it! I got it! (the shell flies through Squid’s open window, knocks into Squid’s sculpture, and it falls over) I got it! I got it! I got it! (Squid in the other room, hears a thump, but he ignores it. Sponge and Pat enter the room via the elevator) Remember Patrick, finders keepers.
Patrick: There it is! (points to the shell that is in the wax sculpture of Squidward)
SpongeBob & Patrick: I got it! I got it! (Patrick pulls the shell out)
Patrick: Bonus points! (Patrick starts to walk off)
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick? I think something’s wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
Patrick: Don’t worry. I know how to do this. (Patrick tries to give CPR but his face turns blue and he floats up to the ceiling but lets out all the air and lands on top of the wax sculpture's head)
SpongeBob: Get off him, Patrick! (Patrick stands up)
Patrick: What are you worried about? (Patrick's behind is now imprinted on Squidward's face) He looks better already. (SpongeBob & Patrick stand him up)
SpongeBob: But he still feels cold. (bring him in front of the window)
Patrick: Well, let’s go put him in the warm.
SpongeBob: Do you think he’ll be ok?
Patrick: You know, you worry too much. The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe... (starts to drool as SpongeBob snaps his fingers) ...me. Hey, what’s that on your shoe? (Sponge looks down)
SpongeBob: I don’t know.
Patrick: It kind of looks like...(a liquidy puddle of green goo is on the floor)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Squidward! (both are screaming as Squidward is powdering his nose)
SpongeBob: No, no, that part goes here.
Patrick: Yeah-yeah, that’s it, uh-huh.
SpongeBob: We’re almost there. We can do this.
Patrick: It’s working, it’s working...
SpongeBob: This is working. (sculpture melts again) Patrick, this isn’t working!
Patrick: Look! (eyes turn over)
SpongeBob: I don’t know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he’s...he’s...he’s pushing up daisies!
Patrick: Oh, I thought he was dead. (SpongeBob & Patrick cling to each other and get scared)
Squidward: Well, are you two going to say something or do I...
SpongeBob: No! Stay back!
Squidward: What is the matter with you two?
Patrick: Don’t, don’t hurt us!
SpongeBob: It was an accident!
Squidward: What are you two talking about? (he notices the goo on the floor and screams) Look what you’ve done to me! When I get my hands on you, I’ll...
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Squidward’s ghost! (SpongeBob & Patrick are bowing before Squidward)> Spare us your ghostly anger! (Patrick is kissing Squidward's feet)
Patrick: Oh yes, Mr. Squidward’s ghost! Please don’t haunt us!
SpongeBob: We’ll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us!
Squidward: Enough! Listen up. Squidward’s ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a horrible fate. (Hisses) All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
SpongeBob: Does that include...
Squidward: Quiet! Now do as you’re told lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward! (Squidward walks off)
Patrick: (whispers to SpongeBob) I think they make a cream for that now. (SpongeBob and Patrick carry out Squidward on his bed)
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Too hot. (walk a little more then stops)
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going. (walks a little more then stops)
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Too loose, Lautrec. (rim shot)
SpongeBob: Too tired... (both stop where they are)
Squidward: Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy. (claps his hands) Slaves, fetch me some nourishment.
SpongeBob: Only the freshest, o spooky one. (both run off. SpongeBob comes back with grapes) A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness. (Squidward eats it while SpongeBob goes and gets a banana) A banana peeled to your likeness, your incorporialness. (squeezes it into Squidward's mouth. Patrick comes back with a watermelon and drops it into Squidward's mouth)
Patrick: One watermelon fresh from the manure field, your spookiness. (Squidward falls down and stands up with a watermelon head)
SpongeBob: Art thou not pleased? (Squidward spits out the watermelon)
Squidward: Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that’s very difficult to find.
PatrickWhat do you hunger for, master?
SpongeBob: Whatever you want, we’ll find it. We’ll find it.
Squidward: Cherry pie. (Patrick holds up a cherry pie) Where’d you get that?
Patrick: I found it. (Squidward takes it and throws it somewhere)
Squidward: Well go find it again! (Patrick goes searching for it) SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around. (SpongeBob turns around) That’s better. Now jog in place. (SpongeBob jogs in place) Now say flank stank. (SpongeBob says it) I think I’m beginning to like this. Stop. (SpongeBob stops) Now, play me an elaborate song with this! (gives SpongeBob a tissue)
SpongeBob: But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
Squidward: Oh, my. Always having to have it our way, don’t we? Oh, boo-hoo. (SpongeBob tries to get the tissue as music)
SpongeBob: I can’t do it! (Squidward stands up)
Squidward: Well, I hope you don’t have any plans tonight, because you’re not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song. (walks away. Day turns into night and into day again and SpongeBob is lying on the ground with the tissue on his nose) What’s this? Napping on the job? You’re supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward’s ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.

Patrick: (comes back with the pie) I found it. (Squidward takes it)
Squidward: I’ll take that! (throws pie in Patrick's face then walks away)
Patrick: Yes, your ghostliness. This is fun. (SpongeBob is sen walking down a dark hallway)
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you ready for this?
Patrick: Yes. (SpongeBob walks a couple steps forward)
SpongeBob: Ok, let’s go. Patrick, are you coming? (Patrick is facing the wrong way)
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it’s this way.
Patrick: Where?
SpongeBob: Here.
Patrick: (turns around) Oh, coming! (both enter a room in the back with a bunch of junk in it) How are we going to clean up all this mess?
SpongeBob: It’s easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! (tears the wall)
Patrick: Oh look, you missed some. (SpongeBob picks up a book)
SpongeBob: Oh, let’s see. It’s a comic book, and look at this. It’s the origin on the Flying Dutchman. (shows picture in book) It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don’t you get it, Patrick?
Patrick: We’re going to go shopping?
SpongeBob: No! We’re gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. (Squidward is laying on the couch when something hits him)
Squidward: Ow, what the heck was that?
SpongeBob: Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
Squidward: Ceremony for what?
SpongeBob: We’re going to put you to rest.
Squidward: I don’t want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done! Now, did you clean the back room yet?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, really? I’m going to go check. (walks off. Opens door and screams because he sees Patrick & SpongeBob with a coffin)
SpongeBob: Ok, get in.
Squidward: Are you crazy? I’m not getting in that thing.
SpongeBob: But you said we could put you to rest.
Squidward: I didn’t say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
SpongeBob: Ok. (SpongeBob & Patrick walk outside)
Squidward: Now what? (Squidward sees SpongeBob writing on a tombstone)
SpongeBob: I wrote 'Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but...' (Squidward screams) Oh, hi Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
Squidward: SpongeBob! Cut that out!
SpongeBob: Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. (a bus with a load of people are in front of Squidward's house)
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
SpongeBob: No, just into this hole. (Squidward sighs)
Squidward: SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. (Squidward takes off the towel off his head)
SpongeBob: You’re bald?
Squidward: No, I’m not bald! I’m alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home.
SpongeBob: But...
Squidward: Do it!
SpongeBob: (talking to everyone) Go home. But I...Master...
Squidward: I’m not your master. I’m your neighbor. Now do me a favor and stop doing me favors! (walks off)
SpongeBob: As you wish, master.
Patrick: Boy, he really had us fooled.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he’s the fool. He’s a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
Patrick: You’re right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
SpongeBob: Patrick, say that again.
Patrick: That again.
SpongeBob: No, the other thing.
Patrick: No, the other thing.
SpongeBob: No, what you said before when you...
Patrick: No, what you said before when you...
SpongeBob: Never mind. I’ve got an idea.
Patrick: Never mind. I’ve got an idea. (later, Squidward is on his chair outside when SpongeBob is trying to blow a bubble big enough to get Squidward)
SpongeBob: I can’t reach him!
Patrick: Blow harder! (SpongeBob blows a big bubble to consume Squidward) There he goes!
SpongeBob: Isn’t he beautiful?
Patrick: How high’s he going to go? (Squidward sees he's floating)
SpongeBob: All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond. (both of them wave to Squidward) Good-bye, friend.
Patrick: Happy trails! (Squidward tries to yell from the bubble)
SpongeBob & Patrick: You’re welcome! (floats up in the bubble)
SpongeBob: He’s on the other side now.
Patrick: Yeah. (Squidward is above sea in a bubble with seagulls flying around him) He’s in a better place.
Squidward: Huh?
(At the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is sniffing a krabby patty then squirts a mustard "check" on the patty and puts on the bun. Just then SpongeBob hears Pearl come in and crying. SpongeBob gets a pan and puts it on top of his head for protection of the tears)
Mr. Krabs: Don’t cry, love. Daddy’s going to make it all right. Calm down, girl! (a wave of water from the tears busts the door down but SpongeBob pushes the door back up for a couple seconds then the water comes breaking through the door and wiping out all the customers dropping them to the floor. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs with part of a table around his face)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what’s wrong with Pearl?
Mr. Krabs: Her scurvy prom date stood her, boy and now she can’t seem to find another.
Pearl: That’s because there’s only one fish in the sea that's long, tan and handsome as he is. And that’s him!
Mr. Krabs: No, no baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh...I’ll take you! (Pearl begins to cry) What about Squidward? (Squidward is filing his tentacles. Pearl cries even harder) Wait, wait...here, take SpongeBob!
Pearl: Ahh, the fry cook? Do you know what that would do to my complexion? People would mistake me for a planetarium?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
Pearl: I don’t know. But I can’t take him, daddy! They’ll kick me off the most frequently pictured in the yearbook committee.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, they would. We’ve got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom? (everyone runs away)
Pearl: Just don’t be late, SpongeBob. (walks off)
Mr. Krabs: Now listen boy, I’m-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you’re doing it for good old Mr... (real SpongeBob walks up behind him)
SpongeBob: Oh hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It’s pretty realistic isn’t it? (holds up the left arm) I made this part out of...
Mr. Krabs: Never mind that, boy! You’re taking Pearl to her prom!
SpongeBob: Really? Oh, wow! Don’t worry Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert! (now at home) Oh Gary, I’m a prom failure. I couldn’t even get a date for my own junior prom.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl’s old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What is it Gary? What do you have? (Gary hides in his shell while SpongeBob takes out a magazine from Gary's shell. Magazine is 'Long Tan and Handsome') Hey Gary, this magazine gives me an idea! (SpongeBob cuts through some black fabric then sews it up. Then he takes a shower and plucks his eyebrows to put in some new ones. Then he plants some seeds into the tuxedo and waters it to grow a pink flower. Now, he ties his shoes which are on stilts) Long. (pops out of a toaster as some bread) Tan. (licks his two front teeth that are braced up) Handsome. Ok Gary, wait till Pearl gets an eyeful of this! (Gary hides in his shell. Later, SpongeBob’s limo drives up to Mr. Krabs house. SpongeBob rings the door bell and Mr. Krabs opens the door)
Mr. Krabs: Hello? (SpongeBob lowers himself by some sort of crank) What do you think Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn’t he?
Pearl: (wearing a pink dress) Well, at last no one will recognize you. Now listen, SpongeBob, I just want to get through this with my social status intact. (SpongeBob writes down a list of what Pearl wants to do on a notepad) I want to go to the prom, get my picture taken, and I want to dance...(SpongeBob has a big list now) ...I want to drink punch with my friends and don’t do that other thing you’re always doing...
SpongeBob: Uhh, Pearl, we’ve got to get back to the limo.
Pearl: (claps) A limo! Why didn’t you say so? (Pearl grabs SpongeBob and drags him out of the house) I love limousines!
Mr. Krabs: Go easy on him, lassie! I can’t afford to break in a new fry cook! (laughs and closes the door. Now at the prom where the limo is driving up but the back wheels are flat so its screeching on the road.)
SpongeBob: (checks his list) Well, I guess the first thing we should do is... (flash goes off where the pictures are being held)
Pearl: Yay! My first prom picture!
SpongeBob: Uh-uh-uh...(our) first prom picture. (Pearl sprays him with something that deflates his arm)
Pearl: Let’s get this over with. (SpongeBob is having trouble getting over to the photo-shoot) Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Be right there.
Pearl: Will you hurry up?
SpongeBob: Just a second. (SpongeBob messes up his footing and jumps everywhere and apologizes to everyone but eventually gets to the photo-shoot. He holds onto the curtain to keep his balance.) Cheese! (curtain collapses on them and the photo is taken) That’ll be a keeper.
Friend: Hey look, it’s Pearl! Hi Pearl!
Pearl: SpongeBob, here come my friends. Uhh, go get me some punch!
SpongeBob: Prom expert; away! (jumps away as Pearl's friends walk up to her)
Friend: Hi, Pearl!
Pearl: Hi girls.
Friend: I’d like you to meet Billy Fishkins!
Billy: Meep.
Friend #2: And you know Brian Flounder from math class.
Brian: Meep.
Pearl: Hi Brian.
Friend: So, like, where's your date Pearl? We’re all dying to meet him.
Pearl: He’s over at the punch bowl getting me some punch. (friend looks for SpongeBob)
Friend: Ohh, is he the really tall one?
Pearl: Oh yes! (notices what SpongeBob is doing) I mean...oh no. (SpongeBob is trying to reach for the spoon to get some punch but can't reach because he is too tall. He misplaces his footing and gets the punch all over him. Pearl pushes her friends away) Oh, quick, let’s go see how ugly Cindy’s dress is! (SpongeBob hands two glasses of punch to some people) SpongeBob, what are you doing? (SpongeBob has red skin now from the punch. He squeezes some juice from his nose and into the glass)
SpongeBob: Hi Pearl! Come on, it won’t bite!
Pearl: You look ridiculous. (gasps)
SpongeBob: What is it? (Pearl pushes him under the table)
Pearl: Stay down, he’ll see us! It’s my ex-boyfriend, Octavious Rex, a.k.a. long, tan and handsome.
Octavious: Meep.
SpongeBob: Woah. But, I bet he isn’t holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy! (holds it up but another guy takes it away because it's his)
Anchovy: Give me that back.
SpongeBob: (giggles) That just didn’t happen. Let’s go! (takes Pearl to the dance floor) Ready? (dances like crazy)
Pearl: SpongeBob, what are you doing? Can’t you see everybody here is doing ‘the whack’? (the couples are jumping at each other with their chestswe see couples jumping up and hitting each other)
SpongeBob: The Whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one. (tries to jump)
Pearl: Are you sure you can do this? (SpongeBob jumps at Pearl but they hit another couple and send them flying through the food table. One of the people crash through a fruit painting. Painter jumps into a trash can which makes everyone else go crazy) Well, I guess you can take me home now, now that you’ve ruined everything! (cries)
SpongeBob: Don’t cry, the prom expert is here! I haven’t failed yet! (looks through the list he wrote down) Hey, we can still...no, I broke that. We could...no. Don’t cry! D-d-don’t cry. Whatever you do, don’t.... (went through entire list and cries. Runs off)
Friend: Wow, what did you do to him? Poor little guy... (SpongeBob runs into the ladies bathroom. A couple girls run off screaming)
Pearl: (walks up outside the ladies restroom) SpongeBob, are you ok? (SpongeBob mumbles something) Don’t worry SpongeBob, you didn’t mess everything up. (SpongeBob mumbles something) Actually, it was pretty funny when that hot dog landed in Judy’s hair. (SpongeBob mumbles something) But I am having a good time! You know, we haven’t finished our dance yet.
SpongeBob: (mumbles) Can I still wear the wig?
Pearl: Yes, you can still wear the wig. (SpongeBob runs out and grabs Pearl to the dance floor)
SpongeBob: Let’s go!
Song: "Doing the Sponge"
All right, you invertebrates.
I'm gonna teach you how to do The Sponge.
Well, first you take your leg and you stick it in the air,
And then you take the other one and jam it right up there,
You twist yourself around and give a great big lunge,
Now you're doin' The Sponge.
Huh, do The Sponge, Sponge, oh do The Sponge,
Beat your buns you're doin' The Sponge.
Well, now, first you take your leg
And you stick it in the air,
And then you take the other one,
And you jam it right up there,
You twist yourself around
And you give a great big lunge,
Now you're doin', yeah, now you're doin' The Sponge. 


Pearl: (Octavious Rex walks up to Pearl) Get lost, pizza topping! Can’t you see I’m doing the Sponge? (people are still breaking stuff as the paramedics run out carrying people out on their stretcher. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Pearl are still dancing. Pearl takes SpongeBob and wraps him into a basketball. Shoots and the word "score" lights up on the scoreboard. People are the prom pick up both SpongeBob and Pearl and carry them over to the door)
SpongeBob & Pearl: They love us! Yay, we’re popular! (both thrown out of the gym)
Anchovy: Go wreck somebody else’s prom, will ya? (goes back inside gym. Later, SpongeBob & Pearl walking up to her house)
SpongeBob: Gee whiz, Pearl. I’m sorry tonight didn’t go out like you planned.
Pearl: Oh, don’t worry SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun. (Mr. Krabs opens up the door)
Mr. Krabs: A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower! (Pearl gasps) You almost stepped on it. (rakes the flower in the ground. SpongeBob froze in his spot)
Pearl: Oh, Daddy! Well goodnight, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob? (shrugs her shoulders and walks back inside)
Mr. Krabs: Good job, laddie. (winks at him and goes back inside. The real SpongeBob appears from the side)
SpongeBob: Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! (laughs)
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward.
Squidward: All right, I’ll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is?
Squidward: Annoy Squidward Day?
SpongeBob: (laughs) No silly! (gets out a calendar) That’s on the 15th! (day is marked by a picture of Squidward’s head) Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
Squidward: SpongeBob, don’t you know that award is a scam?
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you work harder for no extra money.
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too if you tried harder.
Squidward: Oh, for what? To have my face on the Wall of Shame? (shows wall full of SpongeBob pictures for being Employee of the Month)
SpongeBob: Squidward, you’ve got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it’s the only thing that makes it all worth while.
Mr. Krabs: Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There’s no clear cut winner! (whispering) Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout. (shows Squidward reading a magazine) There could be a new face on the wall this month.
SpongeBob: Huh? (looks over and sees the month of “January” with no picture)
Squidward: That’s right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. (Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh at SpongeBob as he walks over to the wall and imagines Squidward laughing at him in the picture)
SpongeBob: No! (begins to cry) How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much! (Squidward's picture continues to laugh. Scene goes to SpongeBob grilling and flipping patties until he comes to a patty that won’t flip and he tries and tries then he flips the patty on the ceiling and tries to get it off of there and Squidward peeks in)
Squidward: Need some help? (SpongeBob screams) What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Making...Krabby Patties?
Squidward: You’re losing it! Don’t you know that award is a load of... (SpongeBob gets the patty off the ceiling but he flings it into the fan and it sprays Squidward with all the meat)...garbage.
SpongeBob: (jumps off of ceiling) Please don’t tell Mr. Krabs about this! It’ll hurt my chances of winning the award!
Squidward: I already told you, that award is a bunch of... (sprayed with meat again)...baloney!
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
Squidward: (grabs SpongeBob’s hat) It’s a symbol that you’re a chump! (SpongeBob screams)
SpongeBob: No, Squidward!
Squidward: And this is a symbol of what I think of the ‘Employee of the Month’ award! (Squidward lifts his foot and tries to stomp the hat flat but his foot hits something that is under the hat and SpongeBob reveals the stick of lead under it)
SpongeBob: An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
Squidward: I’m telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke! (Squidward walks away but is sprayed with meat for the last time. Then we see SpongeBob looking at all his award photos)
SpongeBob: What if Squidward’s right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless! (every award photo now has an army hat on)
SpongeBob Picture: Stop that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That’s exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!
SpongeBob: But, sir…
SpongeBob Picture: There’s no room for buts in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He’s trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing, and I mean nothing to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?
SpongeBob: Crystal, sir!
SpongeBob Picture: Good! Now move out! (SpongeBob marches away and then we see SpongeBob looking through his windows through binoculars while Squidward gets ready for bed)
SpongeBob: I won’t let Squidward win! (Squidward sets his alarm and walks off) He can’t go to work if he doesn’t wake up. Target sited. (SpongeBob sneaks up to Squidward’s house by sliding on the ground then through one of Squidward’s windows and as he enters he falls to the ground and Squidward’s hears the noise while he is brushing his teeth. Squidward goes to check what it is and SpongeBob is standing behind the plant by the door. Squidward closes the door and SpongeBob slides around the door and then by Squidward’s bed where the alarm clock is. He is about to grab it when he hears the door handle jiggle so he hides in the pillow on the bed. Squidward gets into bed and isn’t comfortable with the pillow as it is so he adjusts it. Tries to adjust it again and you can hear SpongeBob’s giggling. Squidward lays his head down and SpongeBob’s hand reaches out for the clock and Squidward see it. Squidward freaks out and throws the pillow again the wall. The cover comes down and you can see SpongeBob)
Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here? (SpongeBob grabs alarm clock)
SpongeBob: You can’t win that award if you don’t get up for work! (SpongeBob destroys the clock. Squidward has another one he is setting while he is laughing. SpongeBob grabs that one and destroys it while Squidward opens up a closet full of alarm clocks with SpongeBob destroying some of them one by one)
Squidward: Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!
SpongeBob: That can be arranged.
Squidward: You’re a lunatic, SpongeBob!
'SpongeBob: Maybe so, but I’ve won ‘Employee of the Month’ 26 times in a row.
Squidward: Are you trying to say that you are better than me?
SpongeBob: I’ve been better than you 26 months in a row and it’ll be 27 tomorrow.
Squidward: All right, that’s it, square-for-brains! That’s it! I’m going to show you how easy it is to win that award. I’m going to be the next ‘Employee of the Month’! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!
SpongeBob: Well, I’m going in early to wax the floors!
Squidward: Don’t bother; I’ll have done it already by the time you get there!
SpongeBob: Well, you’ll have to get there pretty early to get there before me!
Squidward: I don’t need to sleep! Loser!
SpongeBob: Well, me neither! …26-time loser! (SpongeBob and Squidward are watching each other through their window) Look at him. Watchin’ me.
Squidward: I’m watching you, SpongeBob. You’re not leaving before me.
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, getting sleepy huh?
Squidward: No, how about you?
SpongeBob: Nope! (Squidward gets out his clarinet and plays Brahms' lullaby and puts SpongeBob to sleep. Squidward tries to walk out but falls in a very deep square hole dug up by SpongeBob right in front of his door)
Squidward: SpongeBob! (SpongeBob comes up with a shovel in his hand)
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward! Going somewhere?
Squidward: I’m going to wring you dry when I get out of here! Now get me out of here!
SpongeBob: All right, Squidward, I’ll stop by after work! [Squid screams some more. Sponge walks back to bed] Now to get some rest. Don’t want to look tired for my ‘Employee of the Month’ photo! (SpongeBob goes to his bed and sleeps a while till Squidward gets out the hole) Squidward! (Squidward is nailing boards onto SpongeBob’s front door. SpongeBob saws around it and pushes the door on Squidward and runs away. A cage drops enclosing SpongeBob and Squidward laughs. SpongeBob slides out because he can fit through the bars)
Squidward: SpongeBob! Why you little…! (SpongeBob writes “loser.” on the bottle and runs away. Later he sees a krabby patty)
SpongeBob: Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty! (smells it but the top bun opens up and a claw comes out grabbing SpongeBob’s nose) Aah! Squidward!
Squidward: So long, sponge loser! (Squidward gets caught in a net and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob runs through a barbed-wire fence and Squidward runs by laughing. Squidward is tied by his tentacles and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob is stuck in a brick wall and Squidward runs by laughing. Later the two are trying to drag along some big items. SpongeBob is dragging an anchor and Squidward is dragging a flaming boat) SpongeBob? Truce? (both wave a white flag)
SpongeBob: Truce.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I can’t take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!
SpongeBob: You’re right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. (its now dawn)
Squidward: Ok, let’s have a good clean fight.
SpongeBob: And may the better man win. (shakes hands with Squidward) He’s nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
Squidward: Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can’t trust him as far as you can throw him.
SpongeBob: As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
Squidward: ...I’m gonna make a run for it. (SpongeBob and Squidward stop shaking hands, laugh nervously, and run for the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is opening it up)
Mr. Krabs: Money, money, gonna make some money! (sees SpongeBob and Squidward come running over) Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you’re early! (Mr. Krabs realizes that they aren’t stopping for anything) Wait! (both push Mr. Krabs out of the way and start doing nice stuff)
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!
Squidward: Clean tables, Mr. Krabs! (Squidward presses too hard on the table while he is cleaning and breaks it in half)
SpongeBob: Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What’s going on here? (SpongeBob drops and breaks the dishes and mops them just like that)
SpongeBob: It’s much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: No!
Squidward: Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Look, I’m putting my own money into the register, Mr. Krabs! (SpongeBob puts his money into the register)(Squidward and SpongeBob are in the kitchen) Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!
Squidward: There’s nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I’ll easily double your output, sponge-hog! (both make many patties to overflow the Krusty Krab to where it explodes)
Citizen: Hey, free Krabby Patties! (While the Krabby Patties fall from the sky, Mr. Krabs head is broken through one of SpongeBob’s employee pictures)
Mr. Krabs: Wait, you’ve got to pay for those! Wait, wait, wait! (SpongeBob and Squidward come through the picture frame that Mr. Krabs is in and asks his who is the winner and Mr. Krabs is still arguing about the Krabby Patties)
Narrator: Halloween is no different under the waves. Pirates, skeletons, and sea monsters. (laughs evily) Ohh, sorry. Everyone having fun. Well, almost everyone. (SpongeBob is washing the dishes in the Krusty Krab kitchen. The door creaks open and SpongeBob jumps in surprise) Who's there? (door creeks open some more as SpongeBob goes back to washing some dishes. Turns around and 3 pieces of paper spelling out "boo" turn on the ordering turntable. SpongeBob speeds up the cleaning of the dishes until he finishes)
SpongeBob: Ok, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I’m leaving! (tries running out but Mr. Krabs stops him in his tracks)
Mr. Krabs: Hold on. Don’t you want to hear my annual scary story?
SpongeBob: No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, the worst monster of them all.
SpongeBob: Uhh...no. (opens the door then turns around) Is it a true story?
Mr. Krabs: True as the deep blue.
SpongeBob: Ok, maybe just a little.
Mr. Krabs: Have a seat, me boy. (sits on a log. Mr. Krabs puts a campfire in the middle of them) Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this. (holds up a krabby patty) Only bigger!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: Like I was saying, The Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people’s souls. (holds up a pickle)
SpongeBob: Do souls look like pickles?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them...in his soul bag. (drops the pickle into a bag that has the words "Krusty Krab" crossed out and the word "soul" written above it. Mr. Krabs laughs evilly as Squidward appears behind SpongeBob in a pirate suit)
Squidward: I’ve come for your pickle! (SpongeBob jumps up screaming)
Mr. Krabs: Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year! (Squidward takes his costume off as SpongeBob, in a barrel, sees the pirate was Squidward.)
SpongeBob: Squidward...
Mr. Krabs: Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you’re not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants! (laughs while walking out)
Squidward: (walks up behind SpongeBob) Steal your soul. (SpongeBob jumps out of the Krusty Krab screaming and beings to walk home. As he is walking home, he sees a jack-o-lantern and then he walks up to a kid in a cowboy costume)
Kid: Trick-or-treat! (SpongeBob screams and runs away. The kids parents walk up next to their son)
Mother: It’s ok, son. That’s just SpongeBob Scaredypants. (SpongeBob is walking home until Mrs. Puff drives up and honks sending SpongeBob screaming and jumping to hold onto the street light)
Mrs. Puff: Happy Halloween, Scaredypants. (drives off)
SpongeBob: The name’s SquarePants. It's SquarePants! I don’t get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everyone seems to scare me.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: (carves his pumpkin from the inside) Well, I’m sick of it. (SpongeBob comes out) No more Scaredypants! (notices his pumpkin and screams while running into his closet)
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Gary, it’s Patrick! I’m going to scare him! It’s my turn. (opens the door and tries to scare Patrick) Rawr! (Patrick has some funny glasses on)
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! (SpongeBob screams. Patrick takes his glasses off) Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.
SpongeBob: Why can’t I be frightening for once? Where’s my chance?
Patrick: Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume. (later, SpongeBob walks out of his closet with a big, white sheet on)
SpongeBob: What do you think?
Patrick: Great! You’ll be going as my trick-or-treat bag!
SpongeBob: No, no! I’m the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Uhh...something’s missing. I know! (Patrick runs inside SpongeBob’s closet. A tree falls down but then gets sawed down by Patrick. Patrick comes out with a pair of clogs) Step into these babies, Hans. (SpongeBob steps into the clogs) Terrifying.
SpongeBob: I don’t know Patrick. (doorbell rings)
Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob. It’s little kids! Little kids are easy to scare! (door opens)
Kids: Trick-or-treat!
SpongeBob: (jumps out and tries to scare the kids like he did Patrick) Rawr-rawr! (kids laugh)
Kid #1: Look, it’s the haunted mattress!
SpongeBob: Ok, ok, here’s your candy.
Kid #1: No, please, that was enough of a treat, thank you. (kids walk away laughing)
SpongeBob: I don’t get it, Patrick.
Patrick: SpongeBob, look at my new paper ghost! (Patrick holds scissors in his right hand a has a puppet on his left hand) Oooh, scary.
SpongeBob: That is it, Patrick!
Patrick: What’s it?
SpongeBob: What’s the difference between that ghost and me? (Patrick concentrates)
Patrick: No, no, no wait. Don't tell me. (concentrates more) D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Ok, tell me.
SpongeBob: I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I’m scary! (SpongeBob is now sitting on a chair in his bathroom. Patrick has goggles on)
Patrick: Ok, are you ready?
SpongeBob: (shows paper ghost) Remember, like this. (Patrick razors off SpongeBob’s sides)
Patrick: Are you sure you want to do this?
SpongeBob: Shave me down, make me round! (Patrick razors off more and uses one piece to wipe off his sweat from his forehead)
Patrick: All right, let’s get to it. (razors off more part. Later, SpongeBob is a round ghost)
SpongeBob: What do you think?
Patrick: Perfect. Now that’s scary! (Patrick puts on his funny glasses) Let’s go scare somebody. (SpongeBob runs down a street trying to scare people)
SpongeBob: Oooh...I’m the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Oooh...I don’t know who I am! (man opens door)
SpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I’m the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Oooh, I’m the Flying Dutchman’s best friend! (both run off laughing)
Man: Hey, don’t you kids want your candy? (both jump behind some coral in the shape of a skeleton head)
Patrick: Oh boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch.
SpongeBob: Do you think?
Patrick: Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!
SpongeBob: Who should we scare next?
Patrick: There’s a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited. (kids laughing) Here comes someone now! (SpongeBob jumps out to scare the kids from earlier)
SpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I’m the Flying Dutchman! (SpongeBob & Patrick run off laughing again)
Kid #2: Wasn’t that the Haunted Mattress?
Kid #3: I guess he’s been demoted to the haunted sleeping bag! (kids laugh. Later, Mr. Krabs is bobbing for apples with his daughter Pearl, who is dressed up as Frankenstein’s bride. Mr. Krabs chokes on an apple)
Pearl: Oh, dad, you’re embarrassing me again! (cries and runs off. Krabs spits out the apple which shoots past Squidward and Sandy)
Sandy: Howdy Squidward, I mean, Flying Dutchman. Great party, huh?
Squidward: What are you supposed to be?
Sandy: Why, I’m a pet goldfish in a bowl!
Squidward: I don’t get it. (SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is tied up with some rope which Patrick will lower him in with. SpongeBob opens a door on the roof to peek through to look at the party)
Patrick: Are you ready, SpongeBob? (thumbs up from SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Ok, Patrick, kill the lights! (lights go off and SpongeBob is lowered in appearing with a scary look. Everyone is screaming as Patrick is talking through a megaphone to scare everyone)
Patrick: I am the Flying Dutchman! Booga, booga, booga, booga! Give me your souls! (jellyfish zaps Patrick. He screams and lets the rope go plunging SpongeBob down onto the floor)
Kid #3: Hey, that’s not The Flying Dutchman, that’s SpongeBob!
Sandy: SpongeBob?
Squidward: SpongeBob. (everyone laughs)
Patrick: (using megaphone) I am not SpongeBob. Those are my street clothes! (thunder appears and the front doors are open)
Flying Dutchman: Enough! (everyone gasps as green smoke comes into the Krusty Krab. A green figure appears)
Mr. Krabs: It’s the real Flying Dutchman!
Flying Dutchman: You bet your white lily livers I’m the Flying Dutchman. I’m going to let you in on a little secret. I’m going to steal your souls. (everyone screams) Quiet! (breathes out flames to burn them) You had it coming, you little crybabies. Every year, people dressing like me. (Squidward takes his costume off) Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that’s not the reason I’m taking your souls. (pointing at SpongeBob, who is hanging upside down) No, this is the straw that broke the camel’s back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I’ve seen, yours is the most insulting.
SpongeBob: Do you mean I’m not scary?
Flying Dutchman: You? Scary? (laughs. Takes SpongeBob off the rope) Let me tell you about scary, kid. There’s all kinds of scary things in the world. Spiders are scary, uhh, I’m scary. You, you’re not scary. Ok, let’s get this over with. (evil laugh which makes everyone scream in horror)
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Flying Dutchman: First, I got to get rid of this stupid costume. (takes off SpongeBob’s ghost costume. Though we don't see SpongeBob, yet, Flying Dutchman flies out screaming. SpongeBob is now shown as skinless with just a brain, eyes, and a mouth with the lower half of his body)
SpongeBob: Hey, what do you know? I scared him! (laughs. Everyone runs out screaming) It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody!
Patrick: Yeah, it must have been because of your pink hat.
SpongeBob: Oh, that’s not a hat. That’s my brain.
Patrick: Oh. (runs out screaming)
SpongeBob: Don’t worry, it grows back!
Title card is shown, title jumps on, and a snail trail follows at the end of the title card showing.
SpongeBob: (Gary is on his exercise wheel) Exercise time is over, Gary. (takes Gary off his wheel) We don’t want you getting too thin. (holds up a green, squishy ball) Here, boy. Fetch! (throws it and Gary goes after it but at a slow pace. SpongeBob checks his watch and goes sits on a chair and takes out the newspaper to read. Morning arrives and SpongeBob is asleep in the chair. Gary crawls up to SpongeBob and spits out the ball)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? (sees the ball on the ground) Good job, Gary! I love you Gary. Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary. Gary, Gary, Gary. (scratches his chin which makes Gary purr. Gary climbs up on SpongeBob) Down, boy! (Patrick comes in)
Patrick: SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend! (shows his jellyfishing net off until he hits something breakable) So, you ready or what?
SpongeBob: That was this weekend? I can’t go, I don’t have anyone to take care of Gary! (Squidward knocks. SpongeBob opens door)
Squidward: Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Squidward: What’s a Gary?
SpongeBob: Not 'a' Gary...Gary. He’s my pet snail. (shows Gary to Squidward) Say hello! (Gary is drooling a lot)
Squidward: Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
SpongeBob: I love Gary!
Squidward: Well, I don’t. Get somebody else. (walks off)
SpongeBob: I guess we can’t go away this weekend after all, Patrick. (Squidward stops)
Squidward: Go away?(rewind himself) You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
SpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.
Squidward: As in, not here for three days?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you’ve already said you can’t do it, we understand.
Patrick: Don’t feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Squidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
SpongeBob: You’ll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk... (SpongeBob explains the daily routine with Gary but Squidward is thinking of how much fun he'll have with SpongeBob & Patrick away)
Squidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday. A three-day weekend.
SpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him. (opens a cabinet with a bunch of barrels of Gary's food) The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Squidward: Sure it’s enough? (bus drives up to the pineapple with other jellyfishers inside)
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Patrick: The bus is here! The bus is here! (crashes through the wall and through the bus leaving his starfish shape through each hole) C’mon, SpongeBob!
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Squidward: (pushing SpongeBob out of the house) Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye-bye.
SpongeBob: Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Squidward: I have the memory of an elephant, I’ll take good care of Fred.
SpongeBob: Gary.
Squidward: Right, yeah, right. (bus drives off) Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers! (laughs with joy) They’re gone! (runs inside his Easter Island Head. Gary peeks his eyes out the window)
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: (comes out with shorts on and his nose with sunscreen on it and a chair. Unfolds the chair and sits on it) This is going to be the best three days of my life. (sighs and lays back with a sun reflector in front of him) I’m going to do all the things I can’t normally do because of SpongeBob. (all three days pass and now Squidward is badly sunburned, The bus comes back as the group is chanting "jellyfishing") Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me. (Squidward sees Gary through the window. Gary growls. Squidward's sunburn drains) Ahh, the snail! I forgot the snail! (runs inside the pineapple where Gary is old and withered on the floor. Squidward takes him inside to the kitchen) I've got to do something. (takes all the barrels of food and puts it in his bowl) Ok, ok ,ok. Here we go. Here we go. Right here.(throws the food at Gary trying to get him to eat it) Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. You've got to finish this food.
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick.
Squidward: Come on, eat. Eat! Eat! (SpongeBob gets his house key out. Squidward has to decide about the food) Ohh...
SpongeBob: (sticks the key in the hole and opens the door) Gary! I’m home!
Squidward: (greets SpongeBob with a head full of Gary's food that he ate) Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Squidward! What are you doing here? (Squid swallows all the food)
Squidward: Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
SpongeBob: What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Squidward: So, uhh, well, see you. Good-bye.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. (Gary crawls to SpongeBob still old and wrinkly) I can always count on you. (Gary moans and SpongeBob screams) Gary! Gary, what’s happened to you? What’s wrong? Squidward, something’s wrong with Gary! Squidward! (Squidward frowns cause he can't leave. Later, the doctor's snail-mobile is in front of the pineapple)
Doctor: Yes, yes, it’s just as I thought.
SpongeBob: What?
Doctor: This is definitely a snail.
SpongeBob: I knew it! Oh Squid, did you hear that?
Doctor: Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. (hands the shot to SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Aren’t you going to do it?
Doctor: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I’m too squeamish. (doctor leaves. Squidward runs after him)
Squidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can’t give Gary his plasma. I’m squeamish too.
Squidward: Aww, SpongeBob, I don’t want to do... (Gary moans and coughs badly)
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: Ok, ok, I’ll do it. (takes the shot)
SpongeBob: Now, don’t hurt him, Squidward. Ok, ok, steady. (Squidward tries to give Gary the shot but SpongeBob pulls him away) Wait, that's too hard. Ok, ok, ok, try it again. (Squidward keeps trying but gets the same result every time)
Squidward: Will you hold him still? (snail plasma shot in SpongeBob’s nose)
SpongeBob: Squidward, you’re injected me with snail plasma.
Squidward: Well, you made me do it.
SpongeBob: What’s going to happen to me?
Squidward: Oh, nothing, it’s just a little snail plasma.
SpongeBob: I don’t know, I feel kind of funny!
Squidward: I'm telling you, it's all in your head. (Gary crawls to his water bowl to get a drink)
Squidward: He just needed water?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you’re better! (hugs him)
Squidward: Oh, how touching. I’m going to go home and throw up. Good night.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Squidward: Trust me SpongeBob, nothing’s going to happen to you. You’re fine. (closes door)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don’t worry Gary, Squidward says I’ll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Gary: (jumps up) Meow! (SpongeBob pours food into Gary's bowl but decides to see what it tastes like. He likes it so he eats all of it. Then walks to Gary with the empty bowl)
SpongeBob: Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Sorry Gary, I couldn’t control myself. (burps) Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, no, Squidward’s right. I’m fine. I worry too much. It’s all in my head. I feel tip-top! (SpongeBob walks off but Gary walks faster) Gary, you’ve getting (voice slow, lowers) a lot faster. (walks up to the mirror in the bathroom. His voice echoes) Look at me. Never better. (yelps while his body goes into transformation) I’m ok, Squidward said I’m fine! (SpongeBob yells as his eyes pop out and transform like Gary's eyes) Gary, I’m fine! (SpongeBob’s left arm gradually disappears) That’s ok, I’m a lefty anyway. (his feet disappear) Now I don’t have to buy those new shoes! (his body shortens up like a snail) Ahh, I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeeeow!
Squidward: (in his bed) I never want to see another snail again. Good night, Clary. (knock on door and doorbell rings) I wonder who that could be as if I didn’t already know. (Squidward walks to the door and opens it) SpongeBob, I already told you. You’re gonna be just fi-i-i... (SpongeBob is a fully breaded snail now)
SpongeBob: Meow!
'Squiudward: AAAAH!!!!!!!!!
SpongeBob: Meow! Meow. (Squidward touches SpongeBob’s left eye and it curls up.)
Squidward: AAAAH! (runs back inside shutting the door)
Squidward: SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done? (picks up the snail plasma shot) It's all your fault. (throws it away) Ok, ok, ok, ok, get it together, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Meow! (Squidward screams and puts boards on his door. Turns around and SpongeBob is at his window) Meow. Meow. (Squidward screams) Meow! (Squidward puts more boards on his window but SpongeBob squeezes through the boards holes) Meow. Meow. (Squidward screams and runs into his closet)
Squidward: None of this would be happening if I’d only fed the snail! (SpongeBob squeezes in from under the door)
SpongeBob: Meow! (Squidward screams and runs through his door) Meow. (Squidward runs up and down his ceiling while SpongeBob keeps meowing at him. Outside, his house is bouncing from side to side until its flipped on its side completely. Everything is broken and torn inside. Squidward sits up but is injected with the snail plasma through his nose) Uh-oh! (now SpongeBob, Squidward, and Gary are on a fence)
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Squidward: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Squidward: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Patrick: Will you clam up?! (throws a shoe)
Squidward: Meow, meo... (shoe hits him off the fence)
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Squidward: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

Narrator: Ah, it is Sunday morning in Bikini Bottom, and it is about time for Squidward to practice his clarinet. So get your earplugs ready.
Squidward: (kisses clarinet) I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music. (SpongeBob's alarm horn goes off and sends Squidward’s clarinet into his throat)
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! Want to go jellyfishing? (Squidward tries to yell but his clarinet sounds every time he tries to talk) Great! We'll be right over. (Squidward pulls the clarinet out of his throat. Door knocks are heard)
Squidward: I wonder who that could be. (Squidward opens the door)
SpongeBob: Ready to go?
Squidward: No, I'm not ready to go! (slams the door)
Patrick: He doesn't want to play with us.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just not ready. (Squidward tries to play his clarinet but another knock at door) Ready now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. Then he goes back to try to play clarinet but another knock at door. Squidward gets angry)
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. He then knock at door) Huh? (opens door)
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. Knock at door and opens it)
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. Knock at door and opens it)
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. Knock at door and opens it)
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. Knock at door and opens it)
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. Knock at door and opens it)
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! (slams door. Knock at door and opens it)
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! (slams door then opens it) No! (slams door then opens it. Notices they are both gone then he gets a tap on his shoulder) What?!
SpongeBob: Ready yet?
Squidward: No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?
SpongeBob: Sure we do.
Squidward: What? (shuts door but then realizes he is outside his tiki house so he knocks on the door and SpongeBob opens it)
SpongeBob: Ready? (Squidward pushes them both out of his house)
Squidward: Out! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday. The Krusty Krab is closed. (Squidward gets an idea)
Squidward: Hold on a second. I'll be right out. (closes door.Squidward tip-toes out the other way of his house to the Krusty Krab) Hello? (silence) Ah, alone at last! (tries to play his clarinet but SpongeBob & Patrick enter)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Squidward! Squidward! (Squidward runs into the kitchen as SpongeBob & Patrick come in the Krusty Krab and search for Squidward) Squidward! (Squidward runs into the freezer) Squidward! Oh, Squidward! (Squidward peeks out as SpongeBob & Patrick look for him) Squidward!
SpongeBob: Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields.
Squidward: A-ha! They're finally gone. (tries to open freezer but it's locked from the inside) What the...? Locked? Oh no! Oh, well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time.
Narrator: 2000 Years Later.
(scene shows Squidward still inside the freezer, frozen; the hinges are rusty, and they fall off; the door falls with Squidward frozen behind it; SpongeTron flies past and then back to Squidward)
SpongeTron: Holy Krabby Patties! A frozen cephalopod! (SpongeTron grabs a chrome hammer; from the hammer comes a red laser, which melts the ice... and Squidward's behind; Squidward screams)
Squidward: (trancelike) I'll be out of here in no time.

SpongeTron: Greetings, primitive.
Squidward: Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you?
SpongeTron: SpongeBob? No! (robot voice) I am SpongeTron. (normal voice) Welcome to the future.
Squidward: What?
SpongeTron: Welcome to the future.
Squidward: Uhh, the future? Huh? Okay, what's going on here? Why is everything chrome?
SpongeTron: Everything is chrome in the future!
Squidward: Wha...? Uhh...Uhh... (Squidward looks outside the window) Oh, my! Impossible! He's lying! (flower pops up from underground and a man comes up to the flower and sprays it with chrome paint) He's right!
SpongeTron: Of course I'm right, Squidward. Just ask my clones: Spongetron X, Y, and Z. (Squidward gasps)
Squidward: Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?
SpongeTron: Sure! All 486 of them. (Squidward does a few sit-ups while he talks as if he is trying to wake up) Future! Future! Future! (Spongetron drops a brick on Squidwards head)
Squidward: Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake. Please, we've got to do something!
SpongeTron X, Y, Z: (pull out jellyfishing nets) Jellyfishing! (a two-headed Patrick appears out of nowhere)
Patron: Did somebody say jellyfishing?
SpongeTron: Hi, Patron!
Squidward: Just listen to me. I'm not supposed to be here. I've got to get home to my own time period. I got to go!
SpongeTron: Well, why didn't you just ask? Time machine is down the hall, to the left. (Squidward runs in the door but we hear a can-opener being used. Squidward steps out and is torn into pieces) Whoops! Oh yeah, that one's the can opener. But try the one on the right. (Squidward tries the door on the right and enters in a room that has a slot looking machine that says "past" and "future")
Squidward: Well, I wouldn't have chosen this interior. Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past. (Squidward turns the key and puts the lever on "past". Siren goes off as time machine disappears from where it used to be in the Krusty Krab. After a brief moment, the time machine appears in a primitive look alike Bikini Bottom. Squidward looks out and sees a creature swim by) Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm. (a creature swims by really close to Squidward's face) Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongebBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet. (hears a noise, turns around but some shadow quickle hides. Hears another noise and checks again but a different shadow hides) Huh? (one of the shadow figures swings from tree to tree) What? (a shadow figure hides behind a tree) Huh? (the other shadow figure hides behind a ledge. Squidward keeps walking and then notices a Prehistoric Sponge on the ground) SpongeBob? (Primate Sponge screams) Ahhh!!! Stay back!!! (Primate Sponge touches Squidwards arm and then sniffs his finger from what he touched. Tries to give some to Squidward) Uhh, no thanks. (Squidward feels some breathing on him and he turns and notices a Prehistoric Starfish breathing on him. Prehistoric Starfish smiles and has nasty, rotten teeth) Uhh, hi there. Well, I better be going now. (Prehistoric Sponge grabs Squidward's tentacle) Yes, that's my arm. (Prehistoric Sponge puts Squidward’s arm on his head and prehistoric Starfish licks Squidwards hand) Oh, that's sweet. (Prehistoric Starfish gets scared) What, is it time for your flea bath now? (a jellyfish swims by and Prehistoric Starfish ducks for protection) Oh, it's just a little jellyfish. (Primate Sponge & Prehistoric Starfish run around screaming) Well, I'm going away now. (Squidward walks away) Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools. (Squidward plays his clarinet and each time he tries to play, Primate Sponge or Prehistoric Starfish hollers who are each giving a turn at holding the jellyfish) What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them! (Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are confused) Give me those loincloths! (Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish tear off a piece of their loincloth) I can't believe it. This ought to make things go a little smoother. (gives Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish their nets. They put the nets on their lips. Squidward grabs the nets back) Give me those things. You're supposed to catch them, like this. (Squidward catches the jellyfish in one of the loincloth nets) It's called jellyfishing. (Primate SpongeBob and Prehistoric Starfish grab the nets and chase the jellyfish) Ah, finally! (sits on the ground and plays his clarinet. Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish hear it and go insane and chase Squidward. Squidward runs into the time machine as Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish try to get in by climbing on top of it) Ahh! Get me out of here! (moves the lever up and down really fast and breaks it) Uh-oh. (slow machine spins and stops on 2 lemons and a "bar")
Time Machine: Loser. (Primate Sponge & Prehistoric Starfish are banging on the time machine trying to get to Squidward until it disappears into thin-air. The time machine goes through all sorts of dimensions until it vanishes and Squidward appears in a blank, white space. Squidward sees some sort of colored tiles and lifts one up and it floats and vanishes)
Squidward: He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all... (Squidward becomes tiny) ...alone! (a bunch of "alone" sayings appear with a different voice as each comes up) Vocies:Alone! alnoe. alone! alone. Alone! alone! Alone! Sqiudward: I got to get out of here! (Squidward tries to run but he runs off and on the scene) Where's the time machine?! Where's anything!?!? Where, where, where, where?! (jumps up and down angrily and busts a hole through the ground into the time machine) I want to go home! I want to go home! I want to go home! I want to go home! I miss Bikini Bottom. I miss my Easter Island head. I even miss SpongeBob!! (when Squidward says "SpongeBob", the time machine disappears and reappears in present time Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob & Patrick are still waiting for Squidward) SpongeBob! Patrick!
SpongeBob & Patrick: Hi Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I...I..I was in space and then I went to the future and then I went to the past, and then I was nowhere, but now I'm back and you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.
SpongeBob: Does this mean you want to go...
SpongeBob & Patrick: Jellyfishing?
Squidward: No!! Ohh...who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
SpongeBob & Patrick: You are, Squidward! (SpongeBob & Patrick laugh)
Squidward: (Screen cuts to black) I'm going back.
SpongeBob: (SpongeBob is lurking around, heading home, looking for Sandy because they are playing karate. He suspects the pineapple of being Sandy) Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else. (walks inside) Ah, what a great day at work. (hears something) Huh? Yeah... (tip toes over to the couch but makes duck sounds as he tip toes. He grabs the ducks that are on the floor and kicks them away. Then he runs in front of his couch) I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge... (jumps behind the couch and no one is there) ...bob. (has his back to the couch while he squeezes his eyes through the couch looking for Sandy. When he thinks he's spotted her, he runs out from behind the couch and in front of the tv) I got you now! Hi-yah! (no one is there so he sits on the couch and watches TV)
TV:(shows a realistic pink and yellow fish) Yeah, shopping's weird. Did you ever go into the seafood aisle and say 'Who eats this stuff?"' (SpongeBob laughs)
SpongeBob: I love this show! (Sandy is sitting next to SpongeBob)
Sandy: Me too! (SpongeBob screams and beings to karate more)
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! (Sandy puts on her green karate gear)
Sandy: Hi-yah! (SpongeBob high-kicks in slow-motion)
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! (Sandy runs off then drives forward but SpongeBob jumps his upper half of his body to avoid Sandy) Uhh, just a second. (runs off but returns with his red karate gear on) Safety first! (winks) And now, spin technique! (spins around and lunges towards Sandy)
Sandy: Hi-yah! Yah... (SpongeBob grabs her hand and spins her around)


SpongeBob: Double overhand squirrel knot! (turns her into a round knot and throws her through the door like a bowling ball)
Sandy: I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: That'll be the day. (spins his arms and legs around. Nighttime at Sandy's treedome when the phone rings)
Sandy: Hello? (SpongeBob’s arm tries to karate chop Sandy but Sandy takes SpongeBob’s hand and puts it through the phone to karate chop himself)
Sandy: Nice try, SpongeBrain! (hangs up phone. Later, at Barg N Mart, Sandy is shopping when a box of cereal falls. She thinks it’s SpongeBob so she gets in her karate stance) Yah! (notices the box of cereal) Heh, silly me. (But when she walks a few more steps, SpongeBob is there in his karate gear)
SpongeBob: Hey Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?
Sandy: I don't think so.
SpongeBob: Well, it goes like this! (stretches his arm to ricochet off a shelf and the ceiling to come at Sandy. He stops his arm right before hitting Sandy) Oh wait, I forgot the punch line. ( hits the loose board on the floor sending Sandy into a pile of tin cans) That's a good one, isn't it? (later, SpongeBob is walking down the road) What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful... ( sees a pile of tin cans on the ground so he puts on his karate gear) ...pile of cans? Mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet.
Sandy: No it's not, SpongeBob. (shows him a squirrel mask) This is! (jumps in front of SpongeBob) Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping. (grabs SpongeBob’s tongue and takes out a bottle of hot sauce) Mmmm, my favorite. (SpongeBob screams as a drop of hot sauce hangs over the edge of the bottle and a face appears on the drop)
Hot Sauce Drop: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! By the powers of motleyness, I command this particular drop of hot sauce to be really, really hot!
SpongeBob: Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
Sandy: I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob. (drinks the bottle of hot sauce. While she is doing this, SpongeBob wraps the fake tongue she was holding and around her and spins her)
SpongeBob: Yah... (Sandy karate chops SpongeBob far away)
Sandy: Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Curses! (at Krusty Krab where the line is very long)
Customer: With extra cheese. To go!
Squidward: Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob! (SpongeBob is still wearing his karate gear)
SpongeBob: Oh yeah... gotcha! (SpongeBob opens a door)
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What? (karate chops Squidward's face)
Squidward: I'm going to pretend that didn't happen. (throws two pieces of paper at SpongeBob) Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today! (SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen with tray of patties in his hands)
SpongeBob: Order up... (stops as he sees a customer karate chopping a fly. The customers turns into Sandy who is in her gear and winks at SpongeBob)
Squidward: SpongeBob! Now are you gonna... (SpongeBob throws the tray backwards at Squidward causing the krabby patties to land on Squidward's head)
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and...huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all.
SpongeBob: Hi-yah!
Fred: My leg! (under the floor)
SpongeBob: Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! 'Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this! (does something with his hands while hissing. Points at Fred then walks backwards) Took care of her, yes I did. (bumps into Mr. Krabs) Ohh, ahoy, sir!
Mr. Krabs: What was that?
SpongeBob: But sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.
Mr. Krabs: Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
SpongeBob: No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tae, as some call it.
Mr. Krabs: Kara-tae? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. (he walks off. Later, at closing time, Squid is mopping the floor)
Squidward: SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet? (SpongeBob is staring at his hands)
SpongeBob: Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!
Squidward: Go! (SpongeBob walks into the bathroom with a mop and a bucket in hand. He hears a sneeze so he opens a door but nobody is there)
SpongeBob: Hah! (opens the next stall door and jumps in it) Sandy! (Mr. Krabs walks out of the stall with SpongeBob in his hand)
Mr. Krabs: No more!
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs... (Mr. Krabs grabs a hold of SpongeBob’s mouth)
Mr. Krabs: Shhh. No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired. (lets go of his mouth and walks away)
SpongeBob: Fired? (walks out) No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?
Sandy: Hi-yah! (jumps at SpongeBob karate chopping him)
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate.
Sandy: (stops) Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob. (Sandy karate chops him again)
SpongeBob: No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop. (stops) Sandy: I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob! (karate more)
SpongeBob: No, really! Please, stop! (Mr. Krabs looks out the window)
Mr. Krabs: What the...?! (walks outside) SpongeBob! (SpongeBob screams)
SpongeBob: Ahh, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What did I just get through telling ye, lad?
SpongeBob: But...I...uhh...she...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're fired!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: (high-pitched voice) Fired? (faces gets smaller until its not there anymore)
Mr. Krabs: Eh?
Sandy: SpongeBob? (SpongeBob’s face reappears and he bursts out crying and runs everywhere) Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault. It's...it's mine. He tried to tell me but I wouldn't listen. (SpongeBob is crying into a cup and drinking it. Now he's flipping over and over around Sandy and Mr. Krabs) Just give him another chance, please?
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm... (grabs SpongeBob) Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind. (sniffs Sandy) Mmm, mammals. (walks off)
Sandy: Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing. Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about... (karate chops SpongeBob) ...this?
SpongeBob: (laughs then stops) Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
Sandy: We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.
SpongeBob: We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh... (picks up a rock) We can squeeze things! (squeezes the rock and drops it) Woo! How much fun was that?
Sandy: Almost some.
SpongeBob: I know! We can act like plants. (lies on the ground and opens and closes his legs and arms) Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.
Sandy: Wanna go to the park? (SpongeBob and Sandy at the park. SpongeBob is holding a basket in one hand)
SpongeBob: Karate sure is dumb.
Sandy: Yeah, you can say that again.
SpongeBob: I feel dumb just thinking about it. (puts the basket down) Duh...I'm stupid! I like karate! Doy!
Sandy: You like what?
SpongeBob: Not karate.
Sandy: Ha! I don't even know what that is.
SpongeBob: Me too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...
Fisherman: (casting off his fishing rod) Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: (giggle) For a second that sounded like...
Sandy: Karate?
SpongeBob: Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate? (opens up the basket) Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?
Sandy: Karate.
SpongeBob: What did you say?
Sandy: Uhh, Ketchup. Ketchup! I want Ketchup on my sandwich. (takes out some Ketchup) There we go. (SpongeBob pulls out some barnacle loaf pulls out a barnacle loaf)
SpongeBob: How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?
Sandy: One. Just one.
SpongeBob: One for you! (karate chops a slice off)
Sandy: Hmmm?
SpongeBob: And one for me! (chops off another slice in slow-motion)
Sandy: Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob? Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry. (brings out the barnacle loaf again)
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Sandy. (lifts upu his hand)
Sandy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Sandy: Do you think, umm...do you think I could cut this one?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sure.
Sandy: Thanks. Hi-yah! (chops one slice) Is that enough?
SpongeBob: Maybe just one more. Or two!
Sandy: Or three!
SpongeBob: Or ten!
Sandy: Yes, ten! Because we're REALLY hungry!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right! (chops off more slices and they fly everywhere)
SpongeBob: Time for buns! (throws a bunch of buns in the air and chops them in half)
Sandy: How about some tomatoes?
SpongeBob: And I'll cut the cheese! (both throw the cheese and tomatoes in the air while chopping them into a bunch of slices that land on the patties)
Sandy: And, what else should we slice? (SpongeBob grabs more buns)
SpongeBob: More buns! (Sandy grabs two heads of lettuce)
Sandy: And lettuce!
Both: Yeah! (both slice up more food to complete their krabby patties. When they are done, the entire place is chopped in half. Sandy is slicing wood in half while SpongeBob is resting on a rock)
SpongeBob: Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy? (Sandy has a dazed look on her face) Right? I guess I'll eat one now. (reaches for a patty but Sandy karate chops his arm with her green foam hand)
Sandy: You're mince meat!
SpongeBob: (in his red karate gear) In your dreams! Hi-yah! (both start to karate chop each other. Mr. Krabs is walking through the park)
Mr. Krabs: Huh? What the barnacle? (the whole park is chopped in half)
SpongeBob: Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate? (Mr. Krabs clears his throat to get SpongeBob to scream) Mr. Krabs! (tries to hold a tree back in one piece) Uhh, hey Mr. Krabs, how's it going? (holds the rock in one piece) Nice day, huh? ( half of the tree falls on SpongeBob’s head) Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.
Mr. Krabs: Fire you? (grabs a couple krabby patties) I've got something else in mind. (at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob & Sandy are karate chopping up krabby patties for the customers. Sandy is chopping up the meat and SpongeBob is chopping up the mustard)
Sandy: I love karate!
SpongeBob: I love kara-tae!
Mr. Krabs: I love money-a!
Squidward: I hate all of you.
SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. (takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes)
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. (pulls socks off Gary's eyes) You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail. Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. (snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his eyes and then his mouth on a rock) Hey! Over here! (laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob’s arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob’s nose grows out) Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! (driver's license appears) Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! I sure take a good picture. (drives through a sign that says "Road Ends") Darn! I should have grown a mustache. (the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license) How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. (flies over the Krusty Krab) Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. (Mrs. Puff floats up to him) Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: (takes his license and tears it up) Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! (flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob’s real bed) Ouch! Where am I? (walks and looks up to his real self) Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. (snoring) Meow.
SpongeBob: (walks up to Gary's dream cloud) This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. (jumps into the dream cloud and falls to the ground) Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. Gary! Huh? (walks up to Gary reading a book) Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? (Gary turns around)
Gary: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: (sighs) In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. (picks up a book and reads from it) "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an aurora stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: (flips a few pages) Here's one you might know. (clears throat) There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: (laughs) Gee Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: (jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window) I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. (Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring; SpongeBob runs over) I can't resist! (laughs and jumps in; inside, he opens a door; everything is white, and there is no scenery, just Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride) Hey Patrick!
Patrick: Hi SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: (walks over) You know Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. (transforms into the shape of a skyscraper) Going up! Eh? (sees that Patrick is unresponsive; looks dull) I can make... a million of me! (changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself) Eh? Eh? (the clones disappear) Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. (leaves)
Patrick: Okay. Bye SpongeBob. (kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away) Oh!!! (the quarter falls into a grate) Shoot, that was my last quarter. (sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud)
SpongeBob Ooh, this is gonna be good! (sucks in air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head) Psst! Squidward! (waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing) Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! (sitting in the balcony above the stage) Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. (Squidward starts to play but SpongeBob tells the kind a joke and Squidward stops playing again) SpongeBob!
King: (stops laughing) Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! (turns back to SpongeBob) Now, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: (really mad) Sponge... (snaps his clarinet in half; the audience gasps)...bob?
King: I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it'll be your head! (Squidward laughs nervously)
SpongeBob: Psst! Squidward! (SpongeBob is a clarinet and Squidward looks down so SpongeBob winks and points to himself) Eh? Eh?
Squidward: (throws the broken pieces of the clarinet off the stage and crosses his arms) No way.
King: Ahem! (looks at Squidward)
Squidward: (looks at SpongeBob) Please, SpongeBob. No tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. (Squidward pretends to play SpongeBob while SpongeBob sings in a loud, raucous voice) La la, la la la la la la la la la! (the audience gasps) La la, la la la!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: (crying) Why have you stopped playing that wonderful music? (Squidward looks at SpongeBob and smiles then picks him up and plays) Audience Member: His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears my stain my petticoat. (everyone cheers)
Squidward: (bows) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (a few audience members run up and grab SpongeBob and push Squidward out of the way) What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: (turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him) So long, Squidward! (audience members chase after SpongeBob pushing Squidward into a fruit barrel thing. SpongeBob runs out the door and lands on the top of the tree dome) Hey! I'm at Sandy's! (Sandy sleeping in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door) Aw, this looks neat! I wonder...(falls out of the plane) Ahh!
Sandy: (surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob) Hey SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: (turns upside down) Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. (a target is shown on the ground and SpongeBob and Sandy spins around)
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! (gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate)
Sandy: Not pair of shoes, SpongeBob, parachute!
SpongeBob: Gotcha! (lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger)
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para... (crashes in a truck labeled "Clam Manure" while SpongeBob lands on the target)...medic.
SpongeBob: Ahh! (crashes through the target and flips on the ground) Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. (sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house) H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. (climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream) Uhh...Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! (sits at a table with a green rabbit and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup)
SpongeBob: (waves) Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: Oh. He's next door. (shakes head in disappointment) Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! (gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs) I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. (peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs boat)
Mr. Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! (inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod) You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. (SpongeBob hops into the boat)
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Mr. Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. It's the mighty Moby Dollar! (the dollar hooked on to the line goes above the water and then goes back under) Do you see her, boy? (reels it in) I got her! Here she comes! Thar she blows! (the dollar spits tons of pennies out of its blowhole)
SpongeBob: (laughs) Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Mr. Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: (grabs a small butterfly net) This one?
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: (reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it) Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: Net ready, sir! (opens up the wallet)
Mr. Krabs: (pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet) I did it! (gets excited) I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. (puts down the wallet and wants to shake hands with Mr. Krabs but when he tries the wallet bounces toward the back of the boat); the wallet bounces away)
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! (SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat)
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Mr. Krabs: No! (the dollar jumps in the lagoon and swims away)
SpongeBob: This'll make a make a great fish story, eh Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: (throws a rope around him) You're fired! (fires some sort of gun with a plunger inside it to which the rope is attached)
SpongeBob: Ahh!!!!!!!! (gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building) Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! (zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out) I see you. (stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self) Zap! (shoots a green laser out of his eye) Fish: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! (tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle)
Plankton: I see you...(SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground) Zap! (zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on then walks to the Krusty Krab) Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. (steps on it) Crush! (picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it while walking away) Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream, this is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: (stops and looks) Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! (Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds)
Plankton: Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary!!! (jumps for Gary) I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! (steps on SpongeBob and Gary) Huh? (lifts his foot from pain) Yow!!!
SpongeBob: (looking like a thumbtack) I think he's got the point. (laughs)
Plankton: (as Plankton's voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal size) Whoa! (three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad) Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? (fish on left lifts his foot about to stomp on Plankton) No! No! No! Not the face! (gets stepped on and his dream cloud pops and SpongeBob comes out and plops on the ground)
SpongeBob: Ooh! (SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping) Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. (goes to sleep) Ah....(wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head)
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What do you want from me? Leave me alone! (wakes up from Squidward shaking him) No! No, no, no, no!
Squidward: SpongeBob! (wakes SpongeBob up)
SpongeBob: Ahh!! (friends stand around his bed, except Patrick came late) What are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams! (everyone agrees) Come on, SpongeBob!
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: Meow!
Patrick: Does anyone have a quarter? (all stare at Patrick)
SpongeBob: (in his dream, krabby patties are falling from the sky) It’s raining krabby patties! Yeah! (runs around eating patties. Dream ends with SpongeBob chewing on his pillow then spitting it out. Stomach growls) A quick midnight snack and then it’s back to bed. (kicks the pillow on the ground and jumps on it. Sees Gary meowing in his sleep) Aww, sleep tight, my little angel. (tip-toes past Gary and down the stairs to the fridge) Ah, here it is. (grabs 'sea-nut butter' out of the fridge and walks to the counter where there is food and utensils lying on it) Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep. (as soon as SpongeBob takes a bite of the sandwich, he is out cold. In the morning, his whole house is frozen because he left the fridge open. SpongeBob wakes up shivering) The fridge! (slides over and closes the door then sits down trying to get warm. Tries to stand up but he slips and slides everywhere inside the house stopping on his bed. Pulls the frozen covers over him but the blanket breaks into pieces)
Gary: (wearing a hat and ear muffs) Meow.
SpongeBob: (slides into the bathroom) Oh, Gary, I don’t feel like myself.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don’t be silly, Gary. I don’t get colds. I get the suds.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: No, Gary. If I had the suds, I’d have bubbles coming out of me. (when he sneezes, pink bubbles come out)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I can’t get the suds, ‘cause then I’d have to miss work! (puts his underwear over his mouth & nose then sneezes. Pink bubbles come out again)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this. (turns around and has two bubbles representing his butt cheeks. Each one pops)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I’m not sick. I’m going to work. (at Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is cooking but sneezing at the same time)
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what’s holding up those patties? (SpongeBob turns around looking pale)
SpongeBob: Right away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what’s wrong with you? You’re paler than a baby sea horse.
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: The suds?
SpongeBob: (holds up the krabby patty on a plate) Here’s that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir. (when he sneezes, the krabby patty splatters all over Mr. Krabs head)
Mr. Krabs: (wipes patty off his face) Alright, SpongeBob, you’re too sick to work.
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I’m ok, honest. (Mr. Krabs opens the front door)
Mr. Krabs: No, now go home and get some rest. (SpongeBob walks off) Nothing personal, lad. I just can’t have you sneezing all over my food! (customers hear what Mr. Krabs just said and all spit out their food and run out of the Krusty Krab)> No, wait! Wait!
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I feel horrible. (sneezes. Gary hides in his shell with pink bubble all over his shell) Oh, who am I kidding? I’ve got the suds, no doubt about it. (after he sneezes again, his right eye rolls down his face) I’d better take care of this before it gets out of hand. (picks up the phone and dials Sandy's number)
Sandy: (running on her wheel) Hello?
SpongeBob: Sandy, I’m sick. (puts his eye back into place) Can you escort me to the doctor’s?
Sandy: Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I’ll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in...
SpongeBob: Yeah, ok, Sandy, thanks. (sneezes pink bubble through Sandy's phone. Later, as SpongeBob is getting dressed for the doctor, the doorbell rings) Coming. (opens the door)
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?
SpongeBob: I’m sick, Patrick. I’m going to the doctor.
Patrick: What? Oh, you can’t go!
SpongeBob: Why not, Patrick?
Patrick: I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor’s office is a horrible, horrible place!
SpongeBob: (sits in his chair) It can’t be as horrible as the suds. (sneezes)
Patrick: Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well first, they make you sit in the waiting room.
SpongeBob: Is that the horrible part, Patrick?
Patrick: No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines! (SpongeBob gasps. Patrick takes a piece of coral for a stethoscope) Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.
SpongeBob: No!!
Patrick: Yes! It’s a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it... (takes the end of the piece of coral and puts it on SpongeBob’s chest. SpongeBob jumps and runs around)
SpongeBob: No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No! (flips over on the floor) Patrick, I don’t want to go to the doctor.
Patrick: Exactly. (SpongeBob sneezes. A pink bubble is in the place where Patrick's nose should be then pops)
SpongeBob: You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
Patrick: What else are friends for? (later, SpongeBob is sitting on the table in his kitchen. Patrick is standing behind him. SpongeBob sneezes) It appears as though we’ll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick. (pushes a small cork in one of SpongeBob’s holes. Then plugs up the rest of the holes with more corks) Voila! (SpongeBob sneezes but no bubble come out) Feel better?
SpongeBob: I don’t know. (when he sneezes more and more he enlarges himself)
Patrick: Help, I’m shrinking! (SpongeBob breaks the table) No! Please don’t hurt me!
SpongeBob: No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
Patrick: You think so?
SpongeBob: Sure! At this rate, I’ll be cured in no time. In fact, I’m going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr Patrick!
Patrick: And they said I’d never make anything out of myself.
SpongeBob: (can't dial phone due to large fingers) My fingers are too big for the buttons. Dr Patrick, will you call Sandy for me? (gives Patrick the phone)
Patrick: Sure, patient SpongeBob. (Patrick calls Sandy, who is about to head out for SpongeBob’s place) Hello, Sandy?
Sandy: Hiya, Patrick.
Patrick: I’m calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.
Sandy: I’m on my way over to take him to the hospital.
Patrick: Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.
Sandy: Well, I’m coming over to take a look. I’ll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot...
Patrick: Oh yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don’t bother, Sandy! (hangs up) Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy’s coming! We’ve got to make sure you’re well, or she’ll take you to the doctor! (runs into the kitchen with rubber gloves on and dips them into the sink of water) Don’t touch me, I’m sterile! Scalpel, please. (takes some sea-nut butter and spreads it on SpongeBob’s right foot. Then puts a piece of bread on each side and his shoe on it) Feeling better?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. (later, a string is attached to a door that Patrick closes. A tooth shoots out from the side)
Patrick: Feeling better yet?
SpongeBob: (missing a tooth) Not really.
Patrick: (jumping on SpongeBob in a ballet outfit) How...about...now?
SpongeBob: I don’t...think so. (Patrick puts a big band-aid on SpongeBob’s back)
Patrick: Feeling better?
SpongeBob: No. (Patrick rips the band-aid off and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob’s back)
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Nope. (Patrick rips the band-aid off and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob’s back)
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. (Patrick rips the band-aid off. Later, Sandy arrives outside SpongeBob’s house)
Sandy: Hello, SpongeBob?
Patrick: (black mask on his head) Uh-oh, it’s Sandy. (SpongeBob is tied onto a medieval machine. He sneezes and enlarges himself into a ball. Sandy knocks on the door) There’s no one home.
Sandy: Patrick, you open this door. (Patrick is rolling SpongeBob away) Patrick, sometimes I just don’t understand you. (SpongeBob sneezes) Hey! (walks over to Patrick's house) Ok, Patrick, where’s SpongeBob?
Patrick: Uhh, uhh, he’s not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.
Sandy: Ok, now tell me, (shows two rocks) since when do you have two houses?
Patrick: Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.
Sandy: Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when do houses have feet? (SpongeBob’s feet are sticking out of the other rock)
Patrick: This is my mobile home. (SpongeBob sneezes the rock off)
SpongeBob: Hiya, Sandy.
Patrick: (holding SpongeBob’s hand) Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.
Sandy: Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor.
Patrick: No he doesn’t! I’m taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.
SpongeBob: Ahh... (a green substance-like gas spreads outs all over killing the plants, clams, and everything in its path)
Sandy: See? He’s even worse than I thought.
Patrick: (clothespin on his nose) What do you mean? He’s fine. (Sandy takes the clothespin off of his nose)
SpongeBob: I’m ok, Sandy, really. (sneezes again, enlarging himself more)
Sandy: I’m taking you to the doctor right now. (rolls SpongeBob away)
Patrick: Hey, that’s my patient! (runs over and pushes SpongeBob the opposite way) You can’t take him to the doctor’s.
Sandy: (rolling SpongeBob the other way again) Don’t be silly, Patrick!
Patrick: (carrying SpongeBob the other way) He’s mine! (Sandy is log rolling SpongeBob the opposite way)
Sandy: SpongeBob, you’ll be better soon. (Patrick is using a wheelbarrow for SpongeBob)
Patrick: I’ll save you! (Sandy is using SpongeBob as a basketball)
SpongeBob: I’m b-b-b-better, guys! Really! (both push SpongeBob until he squeezes through them into the air)
Sandy: Now look what you’ve done, Patrick!
Patrick: What I’ve done? Everything was fine until you showed up.
Sandy: You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor.
Patrick: Hey, I’m a good doctor, right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob? (SpongeBob rolls away)
SpongeBob: Guys, I can’t stop! (rolling down a hill, screaming) Help me! (Mr. Krabs is shining up some money)
Mr. Krabs: Shiny dimes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? (runs out the front doors) Stop! SpongeBob! Stop! (SpongeBob stops in front of restaurant) Ooh. (SpongeBob sneezes so hard, the pink bubbles destroy the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs takes SpongeBob to the doctor)
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Well, Mr. SquarePants, it seems you have the suds. Are you ready for your treatment?
SpongeBob: You’re not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: No, silly, you get the sponge treatment. Oh, Hans? (Hans comes through the door and takes SpongeBob out of the room. Shows Hans cleaning SpongeBob with soap) Whoo! (Hans is using real SpongeBob to rub a man's back in the shower) This tickles! (Hans uses real SpongeBob to scrub a man's feet. SpongeBob sniffs) I can smell again! (real SpongeBob being used to wash a plate and a car) Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! (SpongeBob being rinsed off in the sink and put back in the doctor's room)
SpongeBob: I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
Hans: Here is your lollipop. (hands SpongeBob a big lollipop. Sandy winks at SpongeBob)
Patrick: A lollipop? (takes a bubble wand and blows a bubble) Hey, doc, I got the suds, too.
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Oh, yes, Dr. Patrick, we have a special treatment for you.
Patrick: (Patrick gets taken away by Hans. He's being washed in the sink with soap) Hey, wait. (used on a cactus) Ouch! Well, that hurts. (being used to scrub a toilet) Wait, this doesn't seem right!

SpongeBob: (opens doors with a bunch of hearts in his arms) Happy Valentine’s Day, Bikini Bottom! (throws hearts everywhere. Hands one to Squidward but he tears it up. Gives one to Mrs. Puff but her boat runs into a fire hydrant. Gives Plankton a tiny heart. SpongeBob leaps over to Sandy’s place)
Sandy: Happy Valentine's Day, SpongeBob. I'm nuts for you. (gets out an acorn nut with an arrow stuck through it, close-up)
SpongeBob: (puts the acorn away and takes out a bottle of chocolate syrup) Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy. (Close-up of SpongeBob putting his blower in syrup,blows a chocolate heart bubble)
Sandy: (opens a door on her helmet for the chocolate heart to go into. Eats it.) Mmmm, chocolate. Mighty tasty. Patrick's gonna love the one you made for him. (a chocolate balloon is shown and then SpongeBob and Sandy run over and Sandy gets into the basket) Take me through the plan again.
SpongeBob: Ok. (SpongeBob blows a chocolate carnival) Step one: (manly voice) Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival. (a chocolate SpongeBob and Patrick fly in and hop onto the carnival) Step two: I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel. (both of them hop over to the ferries wheel where it rides up to the top. Blows a chocolate hot air balloon) Step three: You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact. (the balloon floats over above the carnival) Step four: Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished. (chocolate bursts all over the screen and then we see Patrick putting a big rock on the ground and pounds the rock into the shape of a heart and picks it up) Hi Patrick.
Patrick: (imagines the heart is talking to him) Hello?
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Oh my gosh! Sponge...SpongeBob is stuck inside this rock! Ahh! Hold on buddy, I'll get you out! (smashes the rock into a pile of dirt) SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Patrick...
Patrick: SpongeBob! (cries and rubs the pile of dirt against the side of his face) SpongeBob...!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm right behind you! (Patrick turns around)
Patrick: There you are. (holds the pile of dirt in his hands) Happy Valentine's Day! Here's your present.
SpongeBob: And I have a present for you!
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: It's the greatest... (Patrick gets excited) ...the bestest... (Patrick gets more excited)...the most fantabulous... (Patrick gets even more excited) ...present ever! (bounces and rolls all around all excited and overjoyed) But you can't have it yet. (Patrick stops rolling and bouncing around)
Patrick: Huh? Why not?
SpongeBob: Because it's not ready yet.
Patrick: Is it ready now?
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Do you want to ruin the surprise?
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Patrick: Oh, come on, please!
SpongeBob: Hmmm...nope, sorry.
Patrick: (grabs on to SpongeBob’s legs and feet) You gotta tell me!
SpongeBob: No can do! (laughs) You'll just have to wait! (SpongeBob walks off with Patrick still hanging on his legs and feet)
Patrick: Please. Oh please... (still hanging on his legs we see SpongeBob walking through the middle of nowhere) ...please-please-please-please. Tell me-tell me-tell me. Please?!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, here we are
Patrick: (gasps as he sees the carnival) You got me a carnival? Mine!,Mine! All mine, mine, mine, mine. (Patrick runs inside the carnival and SpongeBob runs in behind him) Mine, mine, mine! All right, everybody out! This is my carnival! SpongeBob: It's not the carnival.
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: (takes a quarter out of his pocket) Here, why don't you take this quarter and...
Patrick: (snatches it from SpongeBob) Oh my gosh, a quarter! I've always wanted a quarter!
SpongeBob: It's not the quarter.
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: Now take that quarter and buy some cotton candy...(Patrick interrupts and SpongeBob’s finger deflates)
Patrick: Cotton candy! I can't believe it! (Patrick chases the cotton candy seller) Cotton candy!
Cotton Candy Seller: Hey, get away! Hey!
Sandy: (over walkie-takie). Sandy to SpongeBob. (SpongeBob takes out a walkie-talkie where Sandy’s voice is coming from) Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Ten-four Sandy, SpongeBob here. (we see Sandy closing in with the balloon on the carnival)
Sandy: (floating toward the carnival in the balloon) I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?
SpongeBob: Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
Sandy: (chuckles) You are such a kidder, Sandy out. That SpongeBob... (a group of chocolate-eating Scallops are heading toward the balloon) Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!
Patrick: So if it's not cotton candy then what is it? I can't take it!
SpongeBob: You'll have to guess!
Patrick: (points at a tent) This tent?
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: (holds up a man in line for something) This guy?
SpongeBob: No. (we see live-acted micro-organisms swimming around; it's Patrick's view through a microscope)
Patrick: This paramecium?
SpongeBob: (laughs) Nope.
Patrick: (giggles) Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'. (runs up the mountain and falls off then runs back to SpongeBob) It wasn't there either!
SpongeBob: Are you sure? (runs up mountain and falls off again. SpongeBob uses his walkie-talkie to tell Sandy something) SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now. (Sandy is using a whip to keep scallops away)
Sandy: Uhh, SpongeBob, we got ourselves a little problem. I got a pack of chocolate-eating scallops trying to rustle the balloon! Hi-yah! Get away, you sweet-toothed varmints! Hi-yah! I'm going to be a little late!
SpongeBob: Late? But what about... (Patrick still jumping on and off mountain) ...Patrick?
Sandy: hing-ya! Take him up to the Ferris wheel and I'll meet you there! Sandy out!
SpongeBob: (puts away the walkie-talkie) If Patrick doesn't get his valentine... (screams)
Patrick: (suddenly appears from behind, all bruised) I'm pretty sure it's not up there, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Uhh...Patrick, actually it's on the Ferris...
Patrick: Ferris wheel! (he grabs Sponge and runs toward it; cut to them on the Ferris wheel being brought to the top) I'm ready for the greatest Valentine's present in the whole world now, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Well this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal. (SpongeBob talks to Sandy again on the walkie-talkie) SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy! (Sandy is fighting the chocolate eating scallops.)
Sandy: Sandy to SpongeBob, I got my ox in a ditch here! I'm way off course!Hi-yah! The scallops are eating the balloon! They're everywhere!Whigh yaa! (one scallop bites the balloon and the air goes out and it floats down) Aw, shoot! We're going down, SpongeBob! Switch to plan B!
SpongeBob: No, no, B, Sandy! No, B! (Patrick is smiling big waiting for his surprise) Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?
Patrick: No...no...eh-gee! Holy mackerel! Is it hot up here or what! (rips off his shirt and moves the ferries wheel seats back and forth and then up and down. Patrick:(Repeated line)Vlantine! Next, the ferries wheel is jumping up and down and then SpongeBob puts out his hand/arm)
SpongeBob: Patrick, here it is! (Patrick stares at SpongeBob’s hand/arm)
Patrick: What's that?
SpongeBob: It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
Patrick: A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake?
SpongeBob: A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day! (Patrick shakes his hand and stares it and makes a grumpy looking face. SpongeBob laughs and throughout their playtime in the carnival, Patrick has the same grumpy look on his face)
Patrick: I've been thinking. At first a handshake doesn't looks like much, but really it's the thought that counts… (lady walks up with a box shaped like a heart full of chocolates in her arms)
Fran: Hey SpongeBob, I just wanted to thank you for this box of chocolates.
SpongeBob: Uh, no problem Fran. (walks off)
Patrick: And even though I was expecting more... (Dave with roses walks up)
Dave: Thanks for the roses, SpongeBob. Happy Valentine's Day.
SpongeBob: You too, Dave. (walks off)
Patrick: And not that it matters that we've been friends for so long... (some woman walks by with a bike)
Lady Fish: Hey SpongeBob, thanks for the bike! (talking to Patrick) Can you believe this guy? I just met him this morning! (Patrick gets mad,growls)
Patrick: (angerly)So as I was saying...
Fish: Excuse me; do you guys have the time?
Patrick: (Patrick gets mad, and roars, which is followed by him picking up and throwing the fish) Patrick need love, too!!!! (Patrick goes psycho freaky.Howls and beats chest which is followed by him running towards the vewiers. Cuts the balloon strings from a salesman and destroys his Balloon cart. We see kids playing a guy in a heart suit.) Kids: We love heart man...
Patrick:I defy you, Heart Man!!! (Patrick rips the suit in half, reveling a fish in his under-wear.)
P.A. System: Attention everyone, there's a chubby pink starfish on the loose! (everyone runs screaming. Patrick sees a twirl-around ride that has hearts on it and goes mad over it)
Patrick: (Psychoticly)Heart on stick must die! (goes to the pole and tries to pick it up. Gives up eventually. Patrick sees a little girl eating a heart-shaped lollipop) Heart on stick must die! (grabs it, breaks it, and stuffs it in his mouth)
SpongeBob: (gasps) Patrick! (Patrick turns around with an berserk look on his face and growls some gurgiling words, then turns round to the crowd. everyone gets scared and runs to a dead-end of one of the carnival sides. Then Patrick goes freaky on them)Patrick:ROOOAAAARRR!!!!! (Everybody whimpers).
Patrick: Give me SpongeBob! (SpongeBob is thrown in front of the group of citizens) You broke my heart! Now I'm gonna break something of yours!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this. (notes the crowd) But, do they?(crowd smile hopefully).
Patrick: They didn't get me anything either! (They throw a pile of gifts at Patrick’s feet) Nope, it's too late for that now...for all of you! (walks onto and over the gifts, wanting to destroy everyone, starting with spongebob. the citizens take a step back and SpongeBob is scared, front veiw of Patricks mad face.)
Sandy: Yee-haw! Get along little shellfish! Gallop you scallops! (whipping the scallops as she lands in the carnival with the balloon)
SpongeBob: Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you! (jumping up and down pointing behind Patrick)
Patrick: Sure it is.
SpongeBob: I'm telling you, it's right there, turn around!
Patrick: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Patrick, just turn around! (everyone is yelling at Patrick to turn around but he doesn’t)
Patrick: You think I'm pretty stupid, do you?
Crowd: Yes! Turn around!
Patrick: No.
Crowd: Turn around!
Patrick: Nuh-uh!
Crowd: (chanting) Turn around! Turn around!
Patrick: Nuh-uh. I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention. I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason...ever!
Sandy: Howdy, Patrick!
Patrick: (turns around) Hi Sandy! (notices the chocolate balloon then is confused and Speaks gibberish)
SpongeBob: Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick! (Patrick jumps for joy and jumps on the balloon)
Patrick: Yay! My valentine! Hey, is this solid chocolate?
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! (Patrick bites the balloon and chocolate spills everywhere. SpongeBob and Patrick are in The mess)
Patrick: Aw SpongeBob, you didn't have to get me anything.
Squidward: (walks out and sits on his lawn chair) Ah, time to relax. (takes out some gum and puts it in his mouth. Throws the gum wrapper away in front of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob's pineapple moves forward closer to the wrapper and he opens the door)
SpongeBob: (gasps) Squidward!
Squidward: (spits out gum) Well, time to go. (folds up the lawn chair and walks to his front door but SpongeBob stops him)
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Now what?
SpongeBob: You dropped this little piece of paper.
Squidward: Yeah, so what?
SpongeBob: I just figured you probably want it back.
Squidward: What’s the big deal? It’s only garbage?
SpongeBob: Garbage? But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of...
Squidward: ...garbage. (walks inside his house)
SpongeBob: So you don’t want it?
Squidward: Right! (closes door)
SpongeBob: Does that mean I can have it?
Squidward: Yes, by all means, take it. (phone rings. Picks it up) Hello?
SpongeBob: You sure?
Squidward: Yes! For the final time, I don’t want that paper. It’s yours forever and ever! (hangs up and sighs. SpongeBob appears from under the table where the phone is. Squidward screams)
SpongeBob: Are you definitely, positively sure?
Squidward: Get out!
SpongeBob: But are you...
Squidward: GEEEEEEEEEEET OOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUT!!! (gets SpongeBob out)
SpongeBob: Last chance to change your mind, Squidward.
Squidward: Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don’t give that paper back to me...ever!
SpongeBob: So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? (Squidward closes the door) Ok, Squidward, that’s a promise I’ll just have to keep. Ah, Mr Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward.
Squidward: (walking up to his clarinet) SpongeBob... (SpongeBob is laughing outside. Squidward tries to play his clarinet but Squidward gets annoyed by SpongeBob's laughter so he peeks out the window) What in the world are you giggling about?
SpongeBob: I’m sorry, Squidward, it’s just... (giggles) ...it’s just that I’m thinking of all the fun I’m going to have with this piece of paper! (Squidward walks back and picks up his clarinet)
Squidward: How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper? (Squidward plays his clarinet but has to stop due to SpongeBob's laughter continuing) Ohh...what can he possibly be doing with that paper?! (peeks out his window and SpongeBob is running around with the piece of paper high, above his head)
SpongeBob: La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this! (twists his lower part of his body around and puts the piece of paper in it so it hangs out. Turns his lower body around) Guess what I am.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I’m also... (deep voice) Super Sponge: soaking up crime. See, here’s my cape. (blows on the piece of paper to make it look like a cape in the wind)
Squidward: Super-moron’s more like it.
SpongeBob: Now I’m... (jumps into the air and stands on his pineapple with no clothes on but the piece of paper in the middle of lower half of his body) SpongeBob Junglepants! (does Tarzan impression)
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: Ugh. SpongeBob Junglepants summon animal friends. (he roars like a lion, makes bird calls, makes a raspberry, makes horn noises, dolphin noises and seal noises)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You’re right Gary. I’m not a jungle boy. I’m a box of army supplies. (jumps off his pineapple with his clothes on) Bringing relief to the hungry troops! (has the paper act as a parachute and floats down to the ground. We see Squidward watching from a safe distance) Landing just in time for the bullfight! (he waves the paper in front of Gary) Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro... (pushes Gary across with his foot) Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a moustache. (pust the piece of paper where a mustache would be) Look at me, I’m a guy with a moustache. A pirate with an eye patch. (puts the paper over one eye) Arrgh, I’m a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch. (puts the paper over one eye) Arrgh, I am not a pirate.
Squidward: Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper. (SpongeBob is rolling the piece of paper on the top of his head. Then he sucks in the paper through one of his holes. Blows it in and out of his holes) How did he do that?
SpongeBob: Look, Gary, oralgami. (puts the paper in his mouth and sticks his tongue out with a bird shape for the paper)
Kids: Bird! Yay! (SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a snowflake) Snowflake, yay! (SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a doll) Paper doll, yay!
Squidward: Hey, that little paper does seem like fun. (puts his hand over his mouth) What am I saying?! I am such an idiot. (laughs) SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun? (opens up a magazine and starts reading it) Now, reading ‘Boring Science Digest,’ that’s fun. (laughs at what the magazine says inside) Erosion. (laughs) Mitosis. (SpongeBob laughs. Later, Squidward is bathing) See, I can have fun taking a bath. (the paper comes flying through the window as an airplane and flies around Squidward a couple times. Then shoots the rubber duck and flies back out the window. The rubber duck sinks under the water. Later, Squidward is painting) Painting fruit, there’s nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything. (SpongeBob is laughing outside. Squidward paints but he paints himself with the piece of paper over his nose. When he notices this, he tears up his painting) I'll prove to him that paper is not fun! (runs outside and whistles while playing paddleball) I’m having fun, la-la-la...
SpongeBob: (bouncing the piece of paper off his nose like it was a paddleball) Isn’t this great? La-la-la-la-la... (SpongeBob jumps up and down) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob, top this one. (takes out a centriloquist doll that looks exactly like him) Hey, little Squidward, what’s gray and ugly and has six arms?
Little Squidward: I don’t know, but have you looked in the mirror lately?
Squidward: What did you... (SpongeBob laughs)
SpongeBob: Oh, that’s a good one, Squidward, now let me try. (folds the paper in half) Have you heard any good jokes, Mr Paper?
Paper: What happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?
SpongeBob: I don’t know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?
Paper: It was all washed up! (a bunch of people come up and laugh with SpongeBob then leave. Squidward runs off)
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Squidward: (riding a shell mobile) Haha, I’m having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this? (SpongeBob comes down with the paper acting as a helicopter)
SpongeBob: Nope. (flies away while Squidward drives his shell-cart through the side of his house. Then he comes uot with his clarinet)
Squidward: Well, you can’t play music with a piece of paper! (plays 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' off-key. Little black musical note symbols fall out of the clarinet)
SpongeBob: (applauding) Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original.
Squidward: What? I didn’t play any wrong notes. (plays the song off-key again)
SpongeBob: Yeah, see, you’re playing it like this... (plays his piece of paper as the clarinet with the note symbols coming out) ...when ordinarily it goes like this... (plays the song on-key) I’m partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself. (plays the song in high notes. A music sheet appears) Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?
Squidward: (grabs the paper but SpongeBob holds onto it) Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it! (SpongeBob still holding on to it) Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go... (jumps up and down)
SpongeBob: I can’t!
Squidward: What do you mean you can’t? (SpongeBob moves Squidward's hand off the piece of paper)
SpongeBob: I can’t! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever.
Squidward: I never said anything like that!
SpongeBob: Sure you did, Squidward, look. (folds the paper a few times to make it look like a flip-book to what Squidward said earlier in the day)
Squidward: Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don’t give that paper back to me… ever!
SpongeBob: Wanna see it again?
Squidward: No, I don’t wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise. (walks off) Maybe I should get going.
Squidward: Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something. (looks around for something to trade) Yeah-yeah, something, something... (reaches in his pocket and takes out something) A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum. (chuckles) I’m going to make you an offer. (SpongeBob looks to see what he has)
SpongeBob: Wow, pocket lint! (shows link and rubberband in Squidward's hand) You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...
Squidward: Not the lint, the rubber band!
SpongeBob: The rubber band? Do I dare?
Squidward: Oh, dare, dare!
SpongeBob: (begins to reach for it) Ok... (stops) Oh, I get it. You’re just testing me. Don’t worry, Squidward, I won’t let you down. A promise is a promise.
Squidward: Listen, you! (puts his nose against SpongeBob's nose) You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal. (later, Squidward is bringing a TV over to SpongeBob's side in a wheelbarrow) Gotta get that paper. (walks back to get more)
SpongeBob: Squidward? (keeps walking back and forth with more stuff)
Squidward: Trade... (walks back)
SpongeBob: Hey, listen.... (Squidward brings his house over)
Squidward: Everything must go! Well, that’s the last of it. (all of Squidward's possessions are beside SpongeBob) I’ve given you everything but the shirt off my back. (SpongeBob looks at the paper)
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it’s...it’s really getting harder and harder to keep my promise.
Squidward: Ok, the shirt! (takes his short off) Take it! Take my shirt!
SpongeBob: Squidward’s shirt. I’ve always loved that shirt. Ok, ok, I’ll trade! (puts the shirt on) I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, cause this is all I’ll need?
Squidward: You can have all that junk, ‘cause now I’ve got this! I’ve got the paper, and you’ve got my useless garbage. (puts the paper on his butt and waves it at SpongeBob) I got it! Haha and you can’t have it. (runs around SpongeBob) I got it, you’re a sucker. You’re a sucker, sucker. (laughs) At last, what should we try first, Mr Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose. (puts the paper on his nose) Look at me! I’m a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait... (puts the paper in his mouth and sticks his tongue out revealing a wadded up piece of paper that is wet) Tada!
Kids: Boo! (Squidward dries off the piece of paper)
Squidward: Ok, ok, uhh, helicopter! (puts the piece of paper on his fingers) Gentlemen, start your engines. I’m flying! Oh yeah, I’m flying! I’m flying! That’s right, that’s right, here we go now. (bends up and down trying to fly) I’m flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying... (sighs) ...flying. (SpongeBob is looking at himself in the mirror with Squidward's shirt still on him while Gary is playing his clarinet) Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground! (trhwos it on the ground) A guy stomping on the piece of paper (stomps on the paper then picks it up) I’m a guy who traded everything he owns for a...
Patrick: (walks up to Squidward chewing gum) ...a worthless piece of paper. (Patrick grabs the paper) Hey, thanks, it’s just what I needed, Squidward. (blows a gum bubble then puts the gum on the piece of paper and throws it behind him in the garbage can Nice shirt, SpongeBob. (laughs)
Squidward: Anybody have any sunscreen?
Mr. Krabs: Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!
SpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look Patrick, eight gold dubloons!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! hah! (Jumps onto table) Mine, mine! Huh?
SpongeBob: Boy Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the dubloons?
SpongeBob: (laughs) There are no real dubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: 'The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt'.
Patrick: Based on a real treasure map.
SpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.
Patrick: Yeah! C'mon sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?
SpongeBob: I cleaned the tables Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
SpongeBob: (chewing) I already took care of it.
Mr. Krabs: Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Patrick: My turn. (rolls dice) Five. (makes strawberry noise while moving piece) (reads card) One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm. (SpongeBob turns eyes toward Mr. Krabs) It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired!
Patrick: But I don't even work here!
Mr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now? (puts hat on Patrick's head)
Patrick: Boy, would I?!
Mr. Krabs: (takes hat off Patrick's head) You're fired!
SpongeBob: My turn. (rolls dice) One, two, three, four. (picks up card and reads it) Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. Well, I see Mr. Krabs zipper is undone.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh! Shiver me timbers!
SpongeBob: (laughs) Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. You're turn again Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: (rolls dice) Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
SpongeBob: (picks up card and reads it) You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Treasure. (digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears) There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
Fred: Rev up those fryers, cause I am sure hungry for one...help! help! My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed! Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
SpongeBob + Patrick: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Six! One, two...I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
SpongeBob: I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. (yawns) See you tomorrow. (walks inside house) (rattling noises heard) Huh? Whose there? (turns light on)
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it is late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta...(opens door)
Mr. Krabs: That's awful lad. If the Dutchman hears ya, we'll never get his treasure.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: I'll roll for ya boy.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: (rolls dice) Eight paces, now that's a good start lad.
SpongeBob: But, Mr....
Mr. Krabs: One, two, three...
SpongeBob: (yelling) MR KRABS! I WANNA GO TO BED! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
Mr. Krabs: A game. That's...right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.
Mr. Krabs: (morning arrives) Avas! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
SpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
SpongeBob: Pirates?
Mr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
SpongeBob + Patrick: Treasure? (dancing around) We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Relay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. (throws them a bag of pirate stuff) Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
Mr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
SpongeBob: Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! (falls on plank)
Patrick: I'm Blind Beard the Pirate. (falls on SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! (sailing underwater) Keep a sharp lookout. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
SpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?
Mr. Krabs: Uh...no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, then.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then." A pirate says, "arrgh!"
SpongeBob: Okie...oops. (laughs) I mean...arrgh! Captain Krabs. (eyes widen) Captain, we're about to hit...uhh...I mean...arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
Mr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!
Patrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...(crash) land.
Mr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr SquarePants?
SpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...(Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off)
SpongeBob: Which way captain?
Mr. Krabs: Answer Patrick. Which was is east?
Patrick: Uhh...let's see, uhh...(points) that way captain!
Mr. Krabs: 9,997...9,998...9,999...10,000! Where's the "X"? Suppose to be right here! 10,000 paces east.
Patrick: Ooh! East? I thought you said "weast".
Mr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?
Patrick: This one, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. 9,551...9,552...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
Patrick: And hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a crew, what am I captain of? Just a bunch of sand! (cries)
Patrick: Don't cry Captain Krabs.
SpongeBob: Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. *both cry*
Mr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
SpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one! (laying on ground at night outside tent)
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
Patrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.
SpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.
Patrick: I know. (laughs) (SpongeBob moves away)
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?
SpongeBob: He's not here.
Patrick: Look! The treasure map.
SpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah...
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're not suppose to look at the map. (Patrick poking the map)
Patrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that is there?
SpongeBob: No, guess there isn't. (Both poking map)(Map opens)
SpongeBob: Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself. (Both laugh) (Eyes enlarge and search the map)
SpongeBob + Patrick: The map, gotta see it, gotta look at it. (Eyes go back in)
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?
SpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
Mr. Krabs: Do you think this is a problem?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aah! Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure?
Patrick: We're sorry.
Mr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
SpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
Patrick: I think that.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
SpongeBob: (gasps) Look! It's the "X".
Mr. Krabs: (eyes go into "X" like symbol) "X" marks the spot!
SpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
SpongeBob: We got it Captain Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me lads. Heave! (Brings treasure up)
Mr. Krabs: We finally found it.
Lady Over voice: The Dutchman's Treasure!
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
Patrick: I don’t know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
SpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
SpongeBob: What about loyalty?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: (sleeping) I'm the Flying Dutchman.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: (sleeping) I'm the Flying Dutchman. Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all. (Lightning)
Flying Dutchman: Who duh up the Dutchman's treasure?
Mr. Krabs: (shoves chest toward SpongeBob and Patrick) They did!
Flying Dutchman: Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!
Flying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
SpongeBob: Wow!
Lady Over voice: Two Gold Dubloons!
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew. Where's my reward?
Flying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble. (Flicks something to Mr. Krabs)
Mr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.
Lady Over voice: Plastic!
Flying Dutchman: Ay, but it's based on a real treasure chest. (laughs)
Patrick: Gee Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
(at Glove World where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside the amusement park)
SpongeBob: (Patrick is licking a glove-sickle) Another fantastic day at Glove World. (bus stops at the bus stop and both of them get in but SpongeBob struggles for a bit with his balloon)
Bus Driver: Ahem. (points to coin deposit)
SpongeBob: Let me get my wallet. (turns around and balloon hits bus driver in face) Wait, let me check this pocket. (turns around and balloon hits him again) No... (turns around and balloon hits bus driver again) Patrick do you have any change?
Patrick: How much do you need?
SpongeBob: How much is it?
Bus Driver: Fifty-cents.
SpongeBob: (turns around and balloon smacks bus driver in the back of the head) Fifty-cents.
Patrick: Nope.
SpongeBob: (turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again) Lemme check my other po...
Bus Driver: Forget it!
SpongeBob: (turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again) What did you say?
Bus Driver: Just take your seat!
SpongeBob: Thanks, mister.
Bus Driver: Yeah, whatev... (SpongeBob turns around and balloon smacks him in the back of the head. Bus driver gets angry)
Patrick: Show me what you got at glove world.
SpongeBob: Ok! Here's my glove light. (turns on light)
Patrick: Wow...
SpongeBob: (puts light inside his head) I see you! (both laugh)
Patrick: I got gloves for my glove action-figure! (puts a tiny glove on the big gloves thumb)
SpongeBob: Cool! (Patrick looks out the window and notices a sign that says "You Are Now Leaving Bikini Bottom" as they drive past it)
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: (a tiny glove is on his nose) Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
SpongeBob: Where did you see that?
Patrick: We just passed the sign. 'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'.
SpongeBob: (gasps) What? (looks out the window)
Patrick: What's wrong SpongeBob? (driving past a sign that says "Bikini Bottom City Limits")
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong... (both scream as bus drives down at a 90-degree angle road. SpongeBob and Patrick fly back and his the back of the bus) ...bus. (SpongeBob walks slowly up front. His face gets all distorted as he is moving closer. His pants rip off and fly at Patrick but Patrick ducks in time. Then SpongeBob’s underwear hits Patrick in the face. Bus comes to an immediate stop and both fly forward and hit the windshield. Then the balloon smacks the bus driver onto the windshield and all of them peel off. SpongeBob & Patrick are kicked off the bus) But sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.
Bus Driver: (hands balloon to SpongeBob) Oh, well. (drives bus away)
Patrick: Where is this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: (reads sign) Rock Bottom. (scroll over to a bus station) It sure is weird around here. Kinda different and the soil looks different. (picks up some green soil)
Green Soil: Do you... (raspberry) mind... (raspberry) putting me down? (SpongeBob shakes him off)
Patrick: SpongeBob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart. (bathroom doors have the ? on one door and the ¿ on the other)
SpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know. (someone comes out the ¿ door. Patrick gasps) Maybe we should wait for one more. (a snake-like creature comes out of the ? door. 3 creatures come out the ¿ door)
Patrick: I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.
SpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, ok. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule. (walks off) Boy, this place sure is creepy. (bus drives by with Patrick's head sticking out the window)
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here. (SpongeBob runs after the bus) SpongeBob...! (bus drives up the 90-degree angle road and SpongeBob tries to run up the road but falls down. Tries a couple more times but is unsuccessful)
SpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus. (puts on Grandpa disguise) Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle. (takes off disguise) I better go wait for the next one. (later, SpongeBob is standing by the bus stop sign with his glove balloon in his right hand) C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary. (notices shoe untied and lets go of the balloon) Uh-oh, shoe's untied. Puts foot on bus sign) Over, under, and over, and loopdy-loop, and over... (bus drives up and then drives off) and through the hole. (later, wind is blowing SpongeBob’s glove hat on his side so he puts it back. Wind blows balloon away) My balloon! (chases after balloon jumping for it when he gets the chance. A bus drives up and then drives off) Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus. Aww, not again! (throws hat down. Notices a creature with a red light on his head for an antenna) Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me? (gives raspberry) Uhh, uhh, yeah, I... (creature runs after balloon) No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know what time the next bus comes... (bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob runs after it but decides to walk back to the bus stop sign) Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what. SpongeBob’s stomach growls) I'm gettin' hungry. (snaps fingers) Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to glove world. (squeezes out 6 tiny glove candies onto his tongue then spits them out) Eww, glove flavored. Hey, what's that? (a kandy machine is shown across the road) A kandy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. (Checks each side of the road to see if a bus is coming) I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what! (stomach growls) I'll only be gone a second. (runs over to the machine. While getting out a quarter, a bus drives up. Runs back across to buss) Hey! (bus drives off) Ooh!! (stomach growls. Takes a few steps across the road and turns around to check for the bus. Takes a few more steps and checks again. Gets to the kandy machine and takes out the quarter. Before inserting it, he checks for a bus. There's no bus so he puts in the quarter but a bus DOES come and drives off. Now he checks to his left down the road and decides to sprint across and get some candy. Pushes some buttons and checks for the bus. The kandy is slowly coming down) Come on, come on! (kandy drops to the bottom. SpongeBob grabs for it but a bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob gets angry. He reaches for the kandy but a bus comes up. Every time he reaches for the kandy, the bus drives forward but when he pulls his arm away, the bus drives backwards. So he decides to leave the kandy and run after the bus, but the bus drives off before he can get there. A creature comes up and takes the kandy) Hey, that was mine! (walks over to the kandy machine. 3 busses drives up and drive off while he's over there so he decides to run back. No more busses come so he shakes the bus sign) Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy. (later, SpongeBob is at the kandy machine staring at it and a bus drives up. Another SpongeBob tip-toes up but the SpongeBob at the kandy machine falls over revealing it to be made of wood. The bus drives off) Tartar sauce!! (SpongeBob is now a bench. A bus drives up but drives off after it notices the SpongeBob bench) Fish paste! (walking into the bus station) I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom. I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise! (sees a giant green round creature standing behind him already in line) Ok, second. I am second in line. (sees another giant creature already in line) Ok, third is good. (another creature is already in line) Fourth, not bad. Cut to SpongeBob at the end of the line behind a yellow creature) Ok, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it. (yellow creature spits out a giant egg on SpongeBob’s head with the number 329 on it)
Window Attendant: Next. (raspberry)
SpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving. (everyone steps forward. Egg hatches 3 baby yellow creatures that jump in front of SpongeBob. SpongeBob hides inside his clothes and goes ballistic. Then comes out and everyone staring at him turns around)
Window Attendant: (time is going fast) (raspberry) Next. (raspberry) Next. (raspberry) Next. (raspberry) Next. Next...
SpongeBob: Finally! Yes, I'm next! (runs up to the window) When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?
Window Attendant: What? (raspberry)
SpongeBob: The bus schedule. The next bus.
Window Attendant: I can't... (raspberry) understand... (raspberry) your accent. (raspberry)
SpongeBob: Duh, next bus... (raspberry) to Bikini... (raspberry) Bottom. (long raspberry)
Window Attendant: Ohh. (raspberry) Why didn't you say so? (raspberry) Next bus leaves in... (raspberry) 5 seconds. (bus leaves) Ohh, tough luck, kid. (raspberry) That's the last one til' morning. (raspberry)
SpongeBob: Oh, (raspberry) no... (raspberry) you don't. (raspberry)
Window Attendant: Goodnight! (puts closed sign up)
SpongeBob: Hold it, I'm not through here! (raspberry) Do you hear me? (raspberry) I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then I am not leaving this spot. (gives 3 raspberries. Lights turn off. SpongeBob laughs nervously) Ok, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light! (turns on light) Ah, that's better. (glove light stops working) This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is...advanced darkness. Hey, if I close my eyes it doesn't seem so dark. (closes eyes. Hears a raspberry in the distance so he opens his eyes) Who's there? (walks down the road) Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking. (hears another raspberry) Running! Better start running! Running! (hears another raspberry) Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting! (runs into the 90-degree angle road. Sits down with scallops flying around his head) Sitting, sitting. Bleeding. (hears noise) Hey, who's there? (hears another raspberry) Ok, that's enough. (hears another raspberry) Don't come closer. (hears another raspberry) I'm warning you! (hears another raspberry) I'm a sponge! (a red light shines around SpongeBob. It's the creature from before that chased after the balloon) Oh, it's only you. (creature ties balloon to SpongeBob’s left wrist) Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem. (creature begins blowing balloon bigger) I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon... (raspberry) has... (raspberry) enough... (raspberry) air... (raspberry) thanks. (gives a few more raspberries as he is floating up) Hey, I get it, balloon travel. Thank... (raspberry) you! (raspberry)
Creature: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: (floats back down in front of his house) Ah, home at last. (balloon pops)
Patrick: (riding another bus to Rock Bottom) Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya.
SpongeBob: Good morning Bikini Bottom! Ahh, what a beautiful day! (SpongeBob's hand appears from a sand castle pineapple with his face drawn on his hand) I wonder if Patrick's at home.
Patrick: Hiya SpongeBob!(PatrickS hand comes over from a sand castle rock with his face drawn on his hand) Whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob: Goin' over to Sandy's place. (both hands walk off together, arrive at a sand castle rock peak.) Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
Sandy: Don't lose your barnacles boys. Hi-yah!( Chops sand castle peak down making a sand image of texas) There it is!
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: Can't ya see? It's Texas?
SpongeBob: Texas? What's a Texas? (wave covers sand and ruins Sandy's Texas display)
Sandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
SpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your tree dome.
Sandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later.( Sandy walks off.)
SpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah! (makes a few karate noises)
Sandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
SpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say Sandy.( Turns around) Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! (grabs Don the Whale from behind and flips him over onto the ground. Don growls and punches SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy? (shown surfing in the air) Surf's up Sandy!
Sandy: No thanks (Enter's jellyfish feild.) (buzzing)
SpongeBob: (Runs after a jellyfish with a net)Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! (Patrick runs after one while laughing, then falls on his face. He gets up and runs again)
SpongeBob: Look Sandy, we caught one!
Sandy: Listen SpongeBob, right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
SpongeBob: (laughs) We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
Patrick: Fly away little critter!
SpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong. Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home! (Sandy cries filling her helmet with Tears. Takes a flusher handle and attaches it to her helmet. Pulls it down and all the water drains down)
SpongeBob: "Err sandy why are you crying?"
Sandy: I'm ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
SpongeBob: Sandy...
Sandy: Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
SpongeBob: Homesick, huh? (Sandy is blind-folded as SpongeBob & Patrick take her somewhere)
Sandy: Dog-gone it, SpongeBob, what is it?
SpongeBob: Tada!( the three are standing outside the Treedome)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Welcome home Sandy! (Sandy cries and runs into Treedome)
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: Go away.( pulls a lever wich brings down a metal covering on the Treedome)
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
Patrick: Maybe it's just a little squirrel thing.(a hole opens up in the top and Sandy comes out wearinhg a cowboy hat and holding a guitar. Sandy tunes it and starts to sing)
Sandy: (Singing) Wish I was back in Teaxs, The oceans no place for a squirrel.(live action texas senery appears behind her)Wish I was in texas, pretteist place in the world oh no.(notes come out of guitar)I know that deep in my heart, I'll always be a texas girl.

Sandy: What did you say?
Patrick: Texas is dumb.
Sandy: Don't you ever take the name of Texas in vain!
SpongeBob: You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?

(Pearl is holding a pie with a can of peas in it(closeup of it) ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats! (SpongeBob and Patrick put on ten gallon water jugs on their head) So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay? (Sandy starts to laugh and tears of laughter spew out and fill her helmet. Sandy uses her flush handle to drain it all out)
SpongeBob: Don't cry anymore, Sandy. I'll get your bags.
Sandy: I ain't cryin,' I'm laughin'! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you’re surrounded by critters that care about ya. (Everyone gathers around Sandy)
Sandy: Huh, duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
SpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?
Sandy: I'm staying! (Everyone cheers)
Patrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas! (cuts back to live action Island) Sandy: what did you say?! Patrick: eerr.. should I start running now?
(At Goo Lagoon where a toy bulldozer is taking down the "Welcome to Goo Lagoon" sign. Plankton jumps out of the bulldozer and laughs evilly. Then he puts two black & white road blocks in front of him and takes out a megaphone)
Plankton: Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly seventeen minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the 'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket'. (takes out a sign that says 'future site of the mega bucket and plants it into the ground. The beach-goers can't hear anything but squeaking)
Woman: Do you hear something? (man sitting beside her shakes his head while the lifeguard tries to listen through his bullhorn)
Plankton: (takes out megaphone) Ok, have it your way. I don’t mind bulldozing over each and every one... (a kid comes over and picks up the bulldozer)
Kid: Mommy, look! Somebody left this toy tractor here.
Kid's Mom: Put that thing down, Billy, it has germs on it. (kid drops it and it lands beside Plankton)
Billy: Ohh, mom.
Plankton: (talks through megaphone) You’ll see. (throws away the megaphone) You’ll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretins beachgoers. But it’s becoming increasingly obvious. I can deny it no longer! (zoom out) I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need... (giant foot almost steps on Plankton but he dives out of the way)) SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Steppin’ on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin’ on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin’ on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin’ on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Plankton: Yes. He’s the one. (laughs evily. The sand on his head falls off)
SpongeBob: I’ll have one... (some kid cuts in front of him)
Kid #2: Two please. (ice cream man gives him two ice creams) Thanks. (walks off)
SpongeBob: One please. (a green eel slithers through SpongeBob and grabs the ice cream)
Eel:' Excuse me. (walks off licking the ice cream)
SpongeBob: One please.
Ice Cream Man: Sorry, kid. We’re all out.
SpongeBob: Aww, barnacles. (he hears crying coming from Plankton, who's sitting on a bench with two ice creams) Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?
Plankton: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. (blows his nose) I’m cryin’ because I’ve got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one! (crys) I don’t know what to do with the other one! (cries then stops and looks at SpongeBob and cries again)
SpongeBob: I’ll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
Plankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
SpongeBob: Sure! (starts to lick the ice cream)
Plankton: SpongeBob? (SpongeBob is still licking the ice cream) SpongeBob? (SpongeBob eats the whole ice cream and is now licking what's left inside. Plankton uses his megaphone to get SpongeBob’s attention) SpongeBob!!
SpongeBob: (turns towards Plankton) Yeah? (spits out ice cream as he talks)
Plankton: Isn’t it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance. (SpongeBob licks his fingers) You can have anything you want with a little training. (SpongeBob licks his fingers again)
SpongeBob: Training?
Plankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
SpongeBob: Assertive, huh?
Plankton: That’s right.
SpongeBob: Anything I want. (licks his lips) Sounds great! (spits more ice cream at Plankton when talking)
Plankton: Wonderful. (laughs evilly then SpongeBob joins in the laughing. Then an adult fish sits on SpongeBob) SpongeBob, don’t let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
SpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you’re sitting on my body, which is also my face.
Plankton: No, no, be assertive! (SpongeBob puts his fingers in the guys pockets)
SpongeBob: Beep beep! (Plankton smacks forehead)
Plankton: Not in-sertive! (adult fish checks his watch then walks away) SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You’ve got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You’re too soft!
SpongeBob: But I’m a spo...
Plankton: Don’t say it! (Plankton spots the eel that took SpongeBob’s ice cream) There’s the guy who took your ice cream. Don’t you want it back?
SpongeBob: Ice cream! (Plankton gets up and runs behind the eel)
Plankton: Listen, you! My friend’s got something to say! (the eel turns around)
Eel: What, who said that? Was it you? (talking to SpongeBob)
Plankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
SpongeBob: That’s my ice cream cone!
Plankton: Great! Now let him have it!
SpongeBob: You can have it.
Eel: Say, thanks! (walks off)
Plankton: No! (jumps inside SpongeBob’s mouth) I’ll show ya how! Hey, pencil neck! (eel turns around) Yeah, you, slither over here! (eel walks over to SpongeBob) Surrender that ice cream cone or every waking moment for you will become a swarming torrent of pain and misery! (eel throws ice cream on SpongeBob’s face)
SpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!
Plankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Plankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you’re maniacal?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.
Plankton: Whatever.
SpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, I like it! (throws the ice cream into his mouth, which lands on Plankton. later, SpongeBob is using a metal detector. It starts beeping really fast) I found something!
Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours? (SpongeBob hands the equipment to him)
SpongeBob: Sure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
SpongeBob: Do you want to take a hike with me?
Fish: Yeah.
Plankton: (angry) Now look what you’ve done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
SpongeBob: Hey, go check in that ditch! (points to the ditch beside them. The fish jumps down in the ditch and finds a treasure chest)
Fish: Wow, buried treasure! Thanks!
SpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, you’ll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you’ll tie him in a knot if you don’t get your metal detector back!
SpongeBob: Hey! I’m gonna tie your shoe if you don’t give that back!
Fish: But I’m wearing sandals!
SpongeBob: Ok, never mind! (Plankton jumps off of SpongeBob) It’s alright, Plankton, he’s wearing sandals. What’s the matter?
Plankton: (putting things into a suitcase) Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. (puts on a black hat) I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
SpongeBob: No it’s not!
Plankton: Forget it! I guess you don’t have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
SpongeBob: But what about airline food?
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night! (rimshot) See, I can be a standup guy. See? (Plankton throws his hat down)
Plankton: SpongeBob, you’ll never get what you want! You’ll always let people step all over you! You’re just like stairs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!
Plankton: Ok, but this is your last chance! (points to people trying to get a tan) Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sunrays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
SpongeBob: Just watch me! (runs over and waves a blanket up and down and builds up sand to make the beach-goers run away) Man, this thing is sandy!
Fred: My leg! (after everyone runs off, SpongeBob is laying on his back with a funnel acting as a sunlamp)
Plankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They’re leaving the beach! (SpongeBob now has a tan and looks brown) SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
SpongeBob: Well, not all of me.
Hot Dog Man: Hot dogs! (the two look over to see the octopus vendor given six customers hot dogs with six of his tentacles) Hot dogs!
Plankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
SpongeBob: I’ll do better than that! (sticks his tongue out so far he grabs the hotdogs and eats them all. The hotdog stand closes down)
Plankton: SpongeBob that was genius! Look at all those kite flyers blocking your view!
SpongeBob: What?
Plankton: Breaking your wind! (SpongeBob uses one of his teeth to boomerang it into cutting the strings off the kites)
Larry: Hey SpongeBob, throw us the ball. (Larry and others are playing volleyball but SpongeBob pops the ball and screams like an elephant. Everyone walks off)
SpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male! Plankton? (Plankton is driving a crane) Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!
Plankton: Exactly.
SpongeBob: You didn’t tell me everyone would leave.
Plankton: Oops. (pushes a button. A sign emerges from under the sand. The sign says "Mega Bucket")
SpongeBob: (gasps) Mega Bucket?! You used me...for land development! That wasn’t nice!
Plankton: Haven’t you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world! (laughs evilly)
SpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?
Plankton: Huh? What are you doing? (SpongeBob brings out the hot dogs he ate earlier and puts them back where they belong. Then he puts the kites back where they were) Wait, SpongeBob! Stop! (a girl is crying because she has sand on her ice cream. SpongeBob takes it and wipes the sand off with his eyebrows) Butterfly kisses. Can’t take it. It’s too cute! It’s...it’s disgusted! (Scooter is crying at his broken surfboard)
SpongeBob: What happened? (points to surfboard)
Scooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!
SpongeBob: No problem! (makes himself a surfboard)
Scooter: Whoa! (grabs the surfboard) Killer!
Plankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it’s too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back! (everyone comes back) Wait! (everyone runs over Plankton. Scooter is surfing)
Scooter: Cowabunga! (Scooter comes back on land and everyone cheers for him. SpongeBob goes back to his normal shape) Thanks, dude! That was awesome!
SpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I’m sorry about the Chum Bucket.
Plankton: Forget about that. I just can’t take so much kindness in one sitting! (bunches up into a ball) Need hatred. (crawls away)
SpongeBob: Volleyball, anyone? (everyone uses SpongeBob as the ball) Service! (every time he is hit he says "ouch")
SpongeBob: Wake up Gary!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: We're moving today!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: That's right! We're moving away. We're going to become peasants! (puts on a hat and takes away Gary's bowl) No more food. (gives Gary a plate with salted clams on it) Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.
Gary: Meow!! (cries)
SpongeBob: April Fools! (puts his bowl back where it was) There ya go, pal!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Whew, I'm thirsty! (takes out a BIG glass of lemonade out of the fridge) This is an extreme thirst! (puts the lemonade into a lot of small glasses with umbrellas) Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools! (holds up a mirror) To me! (laughs on his way to work and Squidward sees him)
Squidward: What's he so happy about? (walks by the calendar and notices its April Fools Day. He panics) April 1st? April Fools Day is SpongeBob’s favorite holiday! (puts a heating pad on his head and dials for the Krusty Krab) Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible.
Mr. Krabs: What'd you catch?
Squidward: I caught sight of the calendar.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hold on Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month. (Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab with an artist uniform on)
Squidward: I have arrived. (SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh) What's so funny? Where's the art dealer? (SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh more)
Mr. Krabs: You just missed him.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
Squidward: Tell me what? (SpongeBob whispers in Squidward's ear)
SpongeBob: He told me to tell you...April Fools. (Squidward lays his hat on Mr. Krabs desk)
Squidward: Well, it's been nice working here. (he walks off) Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward! (grabs Squidward’s legs) It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
Squidward: You do?
SpongeBob: Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs? (Krabs sits on a whoopee cushion and it does its thing. Sponge laughs)
Squidward: Well, as long as it's not me. (Next, we see SpongeBob carrying a tray of burger patties)
Old Lady: Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?
SpongeBob: Sure! They're right here, lady! (lady picks a utensil up)
Old Lady: But this is a spoon.
SpongeBob: April Fools! (lady laughs then Squidward stares at SpongeBob and he runs away. Next, we see SpongeBob behind the register) Welcome to the Krusty Krab, how may I help you?
Customer: Yeah, give me two large fries and a jumbo Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Hey, what's that? (turns around and then SpongeBob turns around and has a smiley face on his back)
Customer: I didn't see anything. Hey, where'd that other guy go? (SpongeBob turns around)
SpongeBob: April Fools! I'm right here!
Customer: (laughs) Hey, that was pretty good. (Squidward notices SpongeBob behind the register)
Squidward: What are you doing behind the counter? (SpongeBob is wiping the floor)
Tom: Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?
SpongeBob: Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up! (fills the cup with ice) Here you go.
Tom: Thanks. (each time he takes a sip of his drink, SpongeBob giggles)
SpongeBob: April Fools! (grabs SpongeBob by the collar)
Tom: What did you do to my drink?
SpongeBob: I...(giggles) I...(giggles)
Tom: You what?!
SpongeBob: You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! (laughs)
Tom: I guess that is pretty funny. (laughs as he walks off.)
SpongeBob: (laughs so hard his tongue pops off) Hey, your shoe's untied. (tongue looks down) April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! (Squidward tries to mute the sound with tissues but he can still hear it) April Fools! (Squidward drops a plate)
Squidward: That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! (squirts some mustard inside a rope circle then shows SpongeBob the mess)
SpongeBob: Oh boy! Something for me to clean up! (SpongeBob is cleaning it and Squidward is standing next to a rope which he is about to cut)
Squidward: April Fools! (cuts the rope which sends SpongeBob into a bag of flour. Squidward is laughing through all of this. Then SpongeBob flees into a wall and then into a customers carcass. Then SpongeBob smashes into the ceiling) I'll catch you, SpongeBob! (he giggles to himself. Sponge falls into the green goop in the garbage can) Oops. (Squid dumps Sponge, who is now the shape of the can, out) April Fools, you little sausage! (he laughs. Sponge starts to tear and cries hysterically and runs out) SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… right?
Kevin: Aww, man, poor kid.
Woman: That guy has definitely got some issues to work out. (Everyone leaves)
Tom: April Fools, jerk.
Squidward: Wait, don't go!
Off-Screen Voice: Hey, you stink!
Squidward: Wait, wait, it was a joke! (looks around at the mess he has made of SpongeBob and gets angry with himself) Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach. (makes silly face) Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo- (throat goes hay-wire) gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought. (Squidward knocks on SpongeBob’s door) SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob? (notices a Krusty Krab hat and goes over there to talk to the mysterious man who we have not seen yet) Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am… (noties its Patrick with the hat on) Patrick? What are you doing here?
Patrick: Digging.
Squidward: Why are you wearing that hat?
Patrick: Hmm, I don't know.
Squidward: Where's SpongeBob?
Patrick: He's in the house. He's depressed.
Squidward: With what?
Patrick: I don't know, but it must have been pretty good to make him cry like that. (Squidward goes to knock on SpongeBob’s door)
Squidward: SpongeBob, let me in there! (tries to turn the handle but SpongeBob’s arm comes from under the door and pulls it inside. Squidward grabs his clarinet) SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! (plays clarinet horribly. SpongeBob opens door)
SpongeBob: What do you want?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. (sticks out tongue while talking)
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: I'm trying to say I'm (makes donkey noises)
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: I'm just trying to say that I'm...(head explodes) There's gotta be an easier way to do this… (Squidward writes a note, puts it in a bottle and rolls it to SpongeBob where he picks it up) Well, aren't you going to open it?
SpongeBob: I can't, I don't have a bottle opener. (Squidward hands SpongeBob a can and Squidward drives to the other side of the road)
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm... (whispers into the can. Puts the can up to his ear but hears some sort of noise. Patrick is flossing his teeth. Squidward throws the binoculars down on the ground) SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am... (waves tentacles in the air and bubbles form. Puts a big bubble on his head and then talks) ...sorry. (pops the bubble) There you go.
SpongeBob: But I couldn't...(Squidward slams door in his face)
Squidward: I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! (walks away. Then an image of Patrick appears in the air)
Patrick: It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that. (Squid continues walking and runs into a ghost image on a guy at the restaurant)
Tom: April Fools, jerk. (runs again but this time his mother appears)
Squid’s Mom: (deep voice) You stink!
Squidward: Mother? (runs back to SpongeBob’s house to apologize) All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, I like you! I like living next door, I like your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... (SpongeBob opens the door slightly)
SpongeBob: Squidward! Is all that true?
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
SpongeBob: Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
Squidward: What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
SpongeBob: I promise.
Squidward: Really? (Sponge opens the door all the way, revealing the citizens of Bikini Bottom inside)
All: April Fools!
Squidward: (twitches eye)April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! (laughs hysterically while going back into his house)
SpongeBob: What would we do without Squidward?
(SpongeBob Patrick are browsing through Fry Cook Museum making noises at every rare item they see)
SpongeBob: Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! (Larry tries to pull the spatula out)
Patrick: Hey SpongeBob, look what it says here. (reads plaque) Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease but all have failed.
SpongeBob: Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
SpongeBob & Patrick: ...the golden spatula. Wow!
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula! (SpongeBob runs up to the spatula and holds it) Okay, I'm ready! (Patrick is about to take a picture)
Old Lady: Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is? (Patrick gets confused and drools)
SpongeBob: The menu section? That's easy, it's over that way. (SpongeBob pulls the spatula out and gray clouds appear above him) Uh-oh.
Old Lady: (deep voice) Holy smokes! (runs away)
Patrick: Rude. Hey, the light changed.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick...
Patrick: Hold on, almost there. (clouds open to a mysterious figure comes out that is known as)
King Neptune: Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Dr. Mindy , sire.
King Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly Sponge. Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny! (laughs) Now step aside as I seek out the real fry cook. (searches for the real spatula taker then comes up to a hot dog stand) Ah! A purveyor of foods. Yes, you must be my new fry cook.
Hot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.
Princess : Then who pulled the spatula from the grease?
Hot Dog Vendor: Well, he did. (points to SpongeBob)
King Neptune: (laughs) It is even funnier a second time! (destroys the hot dog stand with fist) You there, crustacean!
Larry: Who, me?
King Neptune: You have the physique of Atlas!
Larry: (laughs) Thanks, I work out.
King Neptune: Make poses with me!
Larry: Okay!
Both: (show off their muscles) Body slam!
King Neptune: You pulled the spatula from the grease!
Larry: Nope, that was SpongeBob.
King Neptune: This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook? (everyone runs except Patrick) Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know how to cook a burger to suit a royal palate! (Patrick points to SpongeBob) What? Am I expected to believe that this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof? (Patrick shows photo he took of SpongeBob holding spatula) Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.
SpongeBob: Like?
King Neptune: The royal fry cook must be left-handed.
SpongeBob: Actually, I've got two. (shows two left hands)
King Neptune: (snaps fingers) Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear. (SpongeBob shows his red underwear) No, blue. (SpongeBob shows his blue underwar) The royal fry cook's wallet contains... (SpongeBob takes out his wallet) His big toes... (SpongeBob gets ready to show something about his foot) Uhh, he has six...
Patrick: He is the new royal fry cook and you...
King Neptune: Silence! (Patrick gets zapped)
Patrick: Is it hot in here or what? (falls over)
SpongeBob: (gasp) Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar! (Gets grabbed by Neptune's hand)
King Neptune: So, little one, you think you have what it takes to become my royal fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You will be tested with a challenge!
Patrick: (faint, down below) Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any... (Patrick gets zapped again) Ouch.
King Neptune: Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
Patrick: Only two? What are two challenges to someone like Sponge- (Patrick gets zapped again)-Bob
King Neptune: Three challenges!
Patrick: Three? (laughs) Three challenges are nothing. Might as well be 500 challenges!
King Neptune: Enough!! (Patrick gets zapped into a dust pile)
Patrick: We'll settle for one.
King Neptune: There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
SpongeBob: I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
King Neptune: Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him. (Patrick gets zapped to normal)
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? (turns around as we see that his face is now on the bottom of his body above his legs) SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
SpongeBob: How you feeling?
Patrick: Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
King Neptune: And now, see the fate that may lie ahead. For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great. (opens the clouds) Behold! (shown a man taking a shower and he screams) Woopsie. Now, behold! (opens the clouds again and shown the city of Atlantis) My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!
Patrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.
King Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?
SpongeBob: I'm ready.
King Neptune: Very well then. To the Poseidome! (At the Poseidome)
Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off! (Everyone cheers) All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. (King Neptune and SpongeBob shake hands. SpongeBob’s arm disintegrates)
SpongeBob: May the best man win.
Mr. Krabs: Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, start cooking! (talking to SpongeBob) Don't worry lad, I have total confidence in you. (Mr. Krabs has a lot of money in his hands) Put it all on Neptune!
SpongeBob: I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
Patrick: Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: 'Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds.' Well, just look at me now. (bell dings) Go get 'em, tiger! (King Neptune starts making his krabby patties and so does SpongeBob. SpongeBob takes his time going through each important step to make sure his patty comes out right. King Neptune makes his very quickly with help from sea creatures. In the end the score is King Neptune: 1000 SpongeBob: 1)
King Neptune: I win! (everyone cheers but SpongeBob) Loser! Free patties for everyone! (everyone chews a bite out of the patties that K.N. made and they spit it out immediately) Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious! (everyone wants King Neptune to eat one) Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better? (King Neptune grabs a patty from SpongeBob) Give me that! (King Neptune eats it and begins to like it) Mmmm. Why this is so good, I'd like to try it a second time! (King Neptune spits it out and eats it again)
SpongeBob: So, uhh, what do you think?
King Neptune: Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win. (everyone cheers)
SpongeBob & Patrick: (both dancing) We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis! (King Neptune laughs)
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
King Neptune: You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?
SpongeBob: You mean, Patrick can't come?
King Neptune: (laughs) No, of course not.
SpongeBob: And my friends?
King Neptune: Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.
Patrick: (crying and wiping his tears with a tissue) It was nice knowing you, buddy!
SpongeBob: I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you too.
Mr. Krabs: (crying) I lost me bet!
King Neptune: Come SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart... (2-seater bike appears) to Atlantis!
SpongeBob: I...I... (cries) I don't wanna go!
King Neptune: It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it! (King Neptune zaps SpongeBob and he becomes a muscular god. But being the same size, he looks a little strange) Maybe we do have a problem.
SpongeBob: (in a pirate who don't do anything-unlike voice) Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! (Patrick walks in the Krusty Krab still looking the same when King Neptune changed him back to normal but with his face on the bottom)
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. What'll you have? (Patrick drools stupidity then SpongeBob hears King Neptune shout) Can you excuse me?
King Neptune: This accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thy own wrath, stove! (uses his powers to zap the stove) Haha!
SpongeBob: What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
King Neptune: (sighs) Perfect patties are made with love, not magic.
Narrator: Fisherman have quite an effect on our undersea friends.
Squidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table 9. (uses himself as a cleaning tool)
Mr. Krabs: (comes running through the front doors) They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with my own eyes. (everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy) The hooks. The hooks.
Customer #1: How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks. The hooks.
Customer #2: Can you make that to go?
Squidward: You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs: The hooks. So there I was minding my own business...
Squidward: I'd love to hear one of your riveting sea tales, but I have to do my waste basket inspection. (puts a trash-can on his head) Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
Mr. Krabs: Fine, but don't say I didn't warn ya.
SpongeBob: Warn 'em about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.
SpongeBob: The hooks?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. (shapes his arm like a hook) The hooks. They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their pink island colors. And just when you think you found the island of milk and honey they grab you by the britches... (grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgy) ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher until you're hauled up to the surface flopping and gasping for air. And then they cook ya, and then they eat ya, or worse...
SpongeBob: (gasps) What could be worse than that?
Mr. Krabs: Gift shops. (shows gift shop)
SpongeBob: (hides under a box) Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: (pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows) Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick: It's not leaving. It's just taking a break. (SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen) We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni...(trips and falls on face) We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town. (many hooks are dangling) I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob: Where is everybody?
Patrick: I don’t know. There was one kid here, earlier.
SpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...(bumps into a hook) Excuse me. (gasps) Stop Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr Krabs said they were really dangerous.
Patrick: (sits on a hook) Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
SpongeBob: All I know is that Mr. Krabs said...Patrick, don't do that! (Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth) Patrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something. (puts 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand) Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob: Ahh, Patrick, don't!
Patrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel...(hooks pulls him up)
SpongeBob: (gasps) Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend. (Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground) Patrick, you're alive.
Patrick: Am I ever. You should try it.
SpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops.
Patrick: You just jump off before you get too high.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsy.
SpongeBob: Well, no.
Patrick: Wheeee.
SpongeBob: I guess he didn't. (joins Patrick on the hook)
Patrick: Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! (hook pulls him up)
SpongeBob: Ready?
Patrick: Ready.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Geronimo! (jump off)
SpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. (shows real fisherman)
Customer #1: P.U., you call this food?
Customer #2: My sandwich taste like a fried boot.
Customer #3: My sandwich is a fried boot.
Customer #4: Hurry it up, will ya? We're hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it. (everyone argues)
Squidward: Why do you wanna eat this stuff, anyway?
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break. (Mr. Krabs laughs) What?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. (laughs) Now, what were you saying?
Squidward: He took a break.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. (uses his nose to smell) Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
Squidward: But Mr. Krabs, I still need help! (all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob)
Mr. Krabs: (uses his nose to smell again) They should be right here. (SpongeBob & Patrick float down as they are laughing)
Patrick: Again?
SpongeBob: Again!
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! No! No! No!
SpongeBob & Patrick: (pulling on hook) 1, 2, 3...
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Wait!
SpongeBob & Patrick: ...blastoff. (hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock)
Mr. Krabs: Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd...(SpongeBob & Patrick float back down while laughing)...I'd throttle 'em. What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?
SpongeBob: I...I...I...
Patrick: I’ll tell you about the hooks. You ride 'em up, and up, and up, and gently flow down.
Mr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?
SpongeBob: Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna. (shows a can of tuna) With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise. (shows a jar of mayo)
SpongeBob & Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob & Patrick: (raises hands) We promise Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I need a sailor's promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go. (hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the behind)
Mr. Krabs: Yow!! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck.
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap.
SpongeBob: Ok, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr Krabs.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! (comes running out of house) I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way.
SpongeBob: I always go to work this way.
Patrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick: Well I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick: Well that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm going to go have some fun. (Patrick goes up and down the hooks) You know you want to.
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs that I wouldn't go near another... (almost runs into a hook. Gasps) ...hook! (almost touches the hook but takes it back) Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again. Never! (goes back to hook) Is this seat taken? (hook takes him up but when he comes down and turns around, we are shown he is hooked at the pants) Whew. Glad I got that out of my system. (gasps) I'm...hooked. And that means... (shows can of tuna opening with SpongeBob's face in the can. SpongeBob screams) Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl: Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, lade?
SpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob: Umm...no. (hook pulls him a little closer) I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you lade?
SpongeBob: Of course not. (hook pulls him a little closer) I mean, not exactly. (hook pulls him a little closer) I mean, yes, yes I did it. I admit it. (cries) Oh, Mr. Krabs. I'm so ashamed. I mean, look at me. I'm hooked!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob: What am I going to do?
Mr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy. (group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants)
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls. (hook pulls him closer) Doh, ok. I'm taking 'em off. I'm taking 'em off. (takes pants off) There.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...lad? (SpongeBob still has his underwear on. Girls laughs)
SpongeBob: Ahh! Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. (puts up Help Wanted sign on window/door. SpongeBob gasps) But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: (hook pulls him a little closer) Oh, Mr. Krabs. I'll listen. I promise. Please save me, Mr. Krabs. (cries) I promise I'll be good. (underwear tears) Whew. (flees into the door naked)
Girls: Ooh, look! (laughs) It's SpongeBob NudeyPants. (SpongeBob screams and runs)
Squidward: Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward: Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. (both laugh)
Patrick: (bus drops off a can of tuna) Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?
Narrator: Ah, Saturday morning in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is watching his favorite Saturday morning show: The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Enjoying a bowl of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Bran Cereal, and wearing the official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy breakfast biters.
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man... fleet and forceful. By the power of Neptune aided by his young ward... (nothing happens) Aided by his young ward... (Barnacle Boy comes dolling down with a rope attached to him) ...protecting the sea with feats of strength and agility. (both try to flex their muscles but break their backs)
Mermaid Man: To the chiropractor. Away!
TV Announcer: By beating a rogue gallery of villains. Like the Sinister Slug, the Atomic Flounder, and the dreaded Jumbo Shrimp. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy unite! (when rings unite, smoke and sparks show)
Realistic Fish Head: Hey kids, are you ready to hear the winner of the contest?
SpongeBob: I'm ready! I'm ready!
Realistic Fish Head: Our winner will receive a special secret collector's item from The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. (a small card comes down) And the winner is...SpringBoob SquirePin.
SpongeBob: Awww. I worked forever on those life-sized Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Realistic Fish Head: ...for these Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle boy.
SpongeBob: Hey! SpringBoob SquirePin stole my idea!
Realistic Fish Head: (a phone drops and tries to correct the fish) What's that? Oh. It appears I've made a slight error in pronunciation. The real name of the winner is...SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob: (jumps for joy while the pineapple jumps also) Wahoo! Oh, I wonder when my prize will get here. (as he turns around, the prize is already there) My prize! (opens the box as he is crying) Can it be? It is. The Conch Signal. (holds up conch signal) From the Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. (holds up conch signal again) As seen on TV. I wonder if it still works. (leans out the window and tries it but is a very off key sound)
Mermaid Man: The Conch Signal! To the Invisible Boatmobile! (couch lunges them backwards under the floor)
Barnacle Boy: Uhh, Mermaid Man?
Mermaid Man: Yes, Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: We're not in the invisible boat mobile, are we?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, nope. (both fall and stand up to search for the boat)
Barnacle Boy: I told you making the boat invisible was a stupid idea.
Mermaid Man: Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Barnacle Boy: It's gotta be around here somewhere? (hits head on back of boat) Ow! Oh, Mermaid Man, I think I...
Mermaid Man: ...found it! (turns boat on and it burns Barnacle Boy) C'mon, get a move on, son. We don't have all day.
Barnacle Boy: Ignition...on. (pushes a button)
Mermaid Man: Throttle...on. (pulls stick shift backwards)
SpongeBob: Humph. Maybe the Conch Signal doesn't work anymore.
Gary: Meow.
Mermaid Man: Activate torpedo mode. Fire! (head crashes through the wall) Mermaid Man...
Barnacle Boy: (Barnacle boy crashes through the door with his head) ...and Barnacle... (The door falls on the ground with Barnacle boy's head still in it) ...Boy.
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Gary. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, in our home.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I'm...
Mermaid Man: (points at SpongeBob) Oh, my Neptune, he's been horribly disfigured. Oh, blast us! We're too late.
Barnacle Boy: Oh, please. He's not disfigured. He's-he's just that sponge kid again.
Mermaid Man: Oh, yeah. Good to see you, lad. Say, Barnacle Boy, we gotta find out where that Conch Signal came from.
SpongeBob: Oh, that was me. I blew the Conch Signal, sir.
Mermaid Man: Alright. Where's the danger, son? Bring it on. Bring it on!
SpongeBob: Don't worry. There's no danger.
Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: No danger?
Barnacle Boy: Look, there has to be danger. you blew the Conch Signal. When you blow the...where'd you get that thing anyway?
SpongeBob: I won it in a contest.
Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: Contest?
Mermaid Man: They don't tell us anything anymore.
Barnacle Boy: Look, Spongy, that ain't no toy.
Mermaid Man: That's right. The Conch Signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.
Barnacle Boy: But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble. You got that?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
Mermaid Man: Good boy.
Barnacle Boy: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. They're serving meatloaf today.
Mermaid Man: Oh, goody.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies.
(At Shady Retirement Home)
Barnacle Boy: (bangs on bathroom door) Will you hurry up in there? And save me some hot water!
(conch signal is blown)
Mermaid Man: (kicks down the door on top of Barnacle Boy then both jump on couch where it lunges them backwards. Later, shown SpongeBob lying on the floor) Ohh, youth. Cut down in his prime. (SpongeBob moans) Oh, speak to me son.
SpongeBob: Help... Can't...open mayonnaise.
Barnacle Boy: What? I come down in my underwear to open a jar of mayonnaise?
SpongeBob: But...
Barnacle Boy: But nothing. We can't go around socializing, we have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies.
Mermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, think about it. Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to.
Barnacle Boy: Alright, ok. You can blow The Conch every once in a while. Just give us something to do when we show up.
SpongeBob & Mermaid Man: Yay! (Back at the retirement home where MM & BB hear the conch signal again)
Mermaid Man: Danger! (MM & BB do some plumbing in SpongeBob's house. Later they hear the conch signal again and this time they arrange SpongeBob's book shelf. SpongeBob blows the conch signal over and over and then MM & BB get tired and can't get there fast enough)
Barnacle Boy: That's it. Gimme that. (grabs conch signal from SpongeBob) You're running us ragged.
Mermaid Man: Must...must answer clarion call. (he collapses)
Barnacle Boy: We're exhausted.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Barnacle boy. I didn't mean it. I just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes! (starts to cry)
Barnacle Boy: It's too late for that, Mr. Contest Winner. I'm gonna destroy this thing with my sulfur vision. (tries using "heat/sulfur" vision to destroy the conch but is unsuccessful) Well I'll destroy it when I get back to the, uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...
Mermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow, or the villain. Besides, I remember another young whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero. (chuckles)
Barnacle Boy: You don't remember breakfast, you old coot.
Mermaid Man: Maybe the Conch Signal is too much responsibility. But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?
Barnacle Boy: What?
Mermaid Man: To the Invisible Boatmobile.
SpongeBob: Oh...
SpongeBob & Mermaid Man:
Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells,
Barnacle Boy laid an egg,
The invisible boat mobile, lost a wheel...


SpongeBob: Hey, can I drive?
Barnacle Boy: Drive? What do you know about driving the Invisible Boatmobile?
SpongeBob: Tons. Like the windshield wipers are right here. (pushes a button)
Barnacle Boy: Don't touch that button, it's the... (folds into origami swan) ...origami button.
Mermaid Man: When you patrol in the city, you'll always have to be vigilante. On your toes. Constantly alert. Always expect the unexpected.
SpongeBob: Hey! (makes MM & BB jump off the building by scaring them) I've got the donuts!
SpongeBob & Mermaid Man: ...and Barnacle Boy laid an egg. Hey-hey!
Mermaid Man: Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime... (snaps fingers) ...just like that. (laughs)
Atomic Flounder: Help! Help! Help somebody here.
SpongeBob: You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder.
Mermaid Man: Stop, kid. Stop! Let him go.
SpongeBob: But you said he could snap... (snaps fingers) ...just like that.
Atomic Flounder: What? Get off of me. If I weren't retired, I'd, I'd... (screams to make lasers come out of his mouth and burns Barnacle Boy's head) ...do that! Out of my way, punk.
(At The Diner)
SpongeBob: I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and I learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow.
Barnacle Boy: Uh, uh, say, kid, why don't you take this nickel and go see if our theme song in on the jukebox?
SpongeBob: OK. (goes to the jukebox)
Mermaid Man: You know, for a pain in the neck, he's a pretty nice kid.
Barnacle Boy: Let's ditch him.
Mermaid Man: I'm right behind you.
SpongeBob: (looking through the selection of songs) It doesn't seem to be here.
Barnacle Boy: Oh, it's there all right.
Mermaid Man: Keep looking. Diligence. Diligence.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir. (looks again)
Barnacle Boy: Dagnabbit.
Mermaid Man: What's the matter?
Barnacle Boy: Where did we park the Invisible Boatmobile?
SpongeBob: Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked. (deep voice) But I can't let my heroes down. (looks again)
Mermaid Man: Boatmobile, where are you? (tries to find it) Barnacle Boy, I found it. (turns engine on and BB gets burned)
Dirty Bubble: (laughs) Still getting burned off that tail pipe, huh, Barnacle Boy? (laughs)
Barnacle Boy: It's the Dirty Bubble.
Mermaid Man: In all his dirty roundness.
Barnacle boy: Oh, no!
SpongeBob: (runs outside) I found it and it's the special dance mix.
Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: (trapped inside the Dirty Bubble) Help! Help! Help!
SpongeBob: Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy’s arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble. I can't believe it.
Dirty Bubble: (laughs) You cannot save them, Sponge of Mystery. They are trapped by my awesome surface tension.
SpongeBob: You don't understand. You're my most favorite super villain. Can I get your autograph? (gets out a pencil and notepad)
Dirty Bubble: Oh, no. Oh, no, you fool. Stay back. The point. Ooh, ooh. Watch the point Now! (pops Dirty Bubble with pencil)
Mermaid Man: Aha! You saved us, son.
Barnacle Boy: Yeah, you're a hero.
SpongeBob: I am?
Mermaid Man: Are you up for another ride in the Invisible Boatmobile?
All 3:
Oh, Jingle Bells
Mermaid Man smells
Barnacle Boy laid an egg
The Dirty Bubble popped
And Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and SpongeBob got away. Haha!
